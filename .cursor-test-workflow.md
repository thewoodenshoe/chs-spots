# Testing Workflow

## Automatic E2E Testing

After every code change, the following E2E tests are run to validate front-end functionality:

### Test Suite (15 tests - all passing ✅)

1. ✅ Page load and header visibility
2. ✅ Area selector with Daniel Island default
3. ✅ Activity chip with Happy Hour default
4. ✅ Area selector dropdown functionality
5. ✅ Activity filter modal opening
6. ✅ Floating add button display
7. ✅ Submission modal opening
8. ✅ Map container display
9. ✅ Spots display on map
10. ✅ Area selection change
11. ✅ Activity filtering
12. ✅ Mobile viewport support
13. ✅ Closest nearby button display
14. ✅ Header layout on all screen sizes
15. ✅ Page load without critical errors

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Baseline

Tests are based on the current layout (commit 5e8e664) and validate:
- Header with "Charleston Hotspots" title
- Area selector (button-based dropdown with 5 areas)
- Activity chip (clickable, opens filter modal)
- Floating add button (bottom-right)
- Submission modal functionality
- Map display with Google Maps
- Mobile responsiveness

### After Changes

Tests are automatically run after code changes to ensure:
- No regressions in existing functionality
- UI elements remain accessible
- User interactions work correctly
- Layout remains responsive
