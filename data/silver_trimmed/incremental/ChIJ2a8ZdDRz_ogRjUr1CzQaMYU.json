One of the managers, Ashley, is exceptional. She came over and greeted me and made sure I was a satisfied customer. Which, I was. I had the chicken tacos and queso and rice. Make sure you also ask for Cara. A great waitress! I would definitely recommend Condado's Tacos!\n\nTravel Teacher\n\nAnjah\n\nTuesday, December 17, 2024\n\n5 out of 5\n\nAnjah at Condado Tacos was amazing!
