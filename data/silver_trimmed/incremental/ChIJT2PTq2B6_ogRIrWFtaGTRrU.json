In 2020, we moved into our current location on East Ashley Avenue, in a colorful three-story hideaway in the trees located just steps away from Center Street and a block off the beach. A main-level dining room can serve large and small groups, while the patio deck and \"Octopus bar,” featuring a soaring upcycled octopus by artist Jeff Kopish, provide ample seating for families, friends, and sun-kissed beachgoers. A mid-floor services private parties, while the lantern-lit top-floor bar and rooftop deck serve as overflow on busy nights and as a private event space. Street parking available.\nMenus Restaurant Week Menu Beverage Menu Food Menu Happy Hour Menu Kids Menu \nClick to Download the Taco Boy Restaurant Week Menu Below:\nDownload PDF \nBeverages\n\nBuild A Bucket / 22\n\nmix & match any 6 bottles below\n\nTopo Chico / 4\n\nJarritos Soda / 4\n\npineapple, lime, fruit punch, guava\n\nMexican Coke / 4\n\nMexican Fanta / 4\n\nLemonade / 3\n\nFrozen Pink Lemonade / 4\n\nSodas / 3\n\nIced Tea / 3\n\nHibiscus Agua Fresca / 4\n\nhibiscus, lime, water, agave\n\nSuéro / 5\n\nMexico’s hangover cure\n\nMAKE IT A PITCHER! \nPitchers need 2 (or more) to pour\nadd a cointreau floater to any marg +3\n\nCold Margs\n\nCasa or Casa Frozen / 10 • 50\n\nthe classic: tequila blanco, triple sec, organic lime juice, orange juice, splash of simple, salt\nadd a flavor: strawberry, pineapple-passion fruit, mango + 2 $ tequila tuesday: $5 casa margs every tuesday! \nCadillac / 12 • 60\n\ncasa margarita topped with grand marnier floater\n\nSkinny Casa / 11 • 55\n\nlighter version of the casa margarita, organic lime juice, splash of orange juice, agave, salt\n\nSpicy Margarita / 12 • 60\n\ntequila blanco infused with hot peppers, triple sec, agave, lime juice, salt\n\nPineapple Margarita / 12 • 60\n\npineapple-infused tequila, cinnamon, vanilla, lime juice, splash of orange juice, agave, salt\n\nTito-Rita / 12 • 60\n\ntito’s vodka, house made sour mix, tajín rim\nadd a flavor: + $2 strawberry, pineapple-passion fruit, mango\n\nBlood Orange Margarita / 13 • 65\n\nlunazul reposado, triple sec, blood orange, agave, lime juice, agave, agave worm salt\n\nHIBISCUS MARGARITA / 13 • 65\n\ntequila blanco, triple sec, hibiscus cordial, lime juice, splash of orange juice, cinnamon-fennel salt\n\nTropical Frozen Margaritas / 12 • 60\n\n3 options to choose from: mango + salt, strawberry + salt, pineapple-passion fruit + tajín\n\nCocktails & More!\n\nMs. Prickly Punch / 11\n\ntequila blanco, aperol, agave, passion fruit, pineapple, lime juice\n\nFrozen Screwdriver / 10\n\ntaco boy classic, vodka, fresh orange juice\n\nMexican Ashtray + Tequila Shot / 10\n\ntecate with valentina hot sauce, tajín rim + lunazul blanco shot\n\nAbout Taco Boy’s Contigo Lager\nContigo is a Mexican-style lager\nbrewed for Taco Boy with Munkle Brewing Co. in CHS.\nIt took home bronze at the 2024 Great American Beer\nFestival—the world’s largest beer competition!\nMake any draft a pitcher!\n\nDraft Beers\n\nTaco Boy’s Own Contigo Lager / 6 • 24\n\nPacifico / 6 • 24\n\nDos Equis Ambar / 6 • 24\n\nModelo Especial / 6 • 24\n\nPBR / 4 • 16\n\nBottles, Cans, & Buckets\n\nThe Boat Beers / 6 for 28\n\nmiller lite, tecate, bud light, michelob ultra\n\nThe Primo Pack / 6 for 34\n\ncorona, corona light\n\nThe Hydrators / 6 for 52\n\nsunboy spiked coconut water, pineapple, passion fruit\n\nTECATE / 5\n\nBUD LIGHT / 5\n\nMILLER LITE / 5\n\nMichelob Ultra / 6\n\nCorona • Corona Light • Non-Alcoholic / 6\n\nSierra Nevada Hazy Little Thing / 7\n\nSunboy Spiked Coconut Water / 9\n\npineapple, passionfruit\n\nAthletic Brewing Co. / 6\n\nnon-alcoholic mexican-style copper\n\nhigh vibes, no booze\nAsk us about our rotating selection of hemp-derived beverages\n\nChill Sips\n\nWine\n\n12 Ounce Cans / 12\n\nwhite, red, rosé, bubbly\n\nCreate your own flight of 3 one ounce pours, or try them individually!
