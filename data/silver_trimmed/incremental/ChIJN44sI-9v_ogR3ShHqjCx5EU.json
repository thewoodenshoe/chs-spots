The food I ordered was outstanding. I can’t stand food that is over-salted and the Mongolian beef and Ginger shrimp were great! I look forward to coming back.\nBrian Mitchell \nFinally managed to stop in and try this place yesterday. Everything was so tasty. The lunch special was an incredible deal. The amount of food for that price is hard to beat.\nJ M \nGood service, attentive staff. The food was delicious and tasted fresh. Portions are generous. Prices are reasonable for portions. Definitely not an average Chinese restaurant.\nBogdan Dusa \nExcellent food with some of the “rarest” Chinese dishes you can find in the US. The food is wonderfully made, not too heavy, not greasy, and all are appropriately portioned.\nDavid Wong \nAbsolutely fantastic Chinese cuisine. I was very happy with the way that everything was organized. And Not to mention, the food was absolutely fantastic! Highly recommended!\nGlider RS \nThe food was amazing. The hot and sour soup was delicious and just spicy enough, the crispy crab was crazy good! If in the mood for Chinese, this is the place to go!\nKeith Driscoll",
