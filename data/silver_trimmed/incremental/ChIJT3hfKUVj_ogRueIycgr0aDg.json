For fastest service, you can Chat with Pepper or give us a ring at 1-800-CHIPOTLE.\n\nHow long will it take to deliver my food?\n\nAs many times as we've wished for psychic powers, we haven't gotten them YET. Even so, we'll try to provide a reasonable ETA when you place your order. After that, it's up to our delivery partners' to transport your food in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nDoes Chipotle deliver?\n\nYou bet we do. And it's super easy. Whether you place your order through our app, our online portal, or one of our partners' platforms, all you have to do is sit back, relax, and imagine your order, zooming its way to you.\n\nCan I schedule my delivery time?\n\nKinda yes, kinda no. All online or mobile orders will be delivered as soon as possible--hangry folk, rejoice--but if you place a catering order, you’ll be able to choose when you’d like to receive your large-format deliciousness.\n\nCan I cancel my delivery after I've submitted my order?\n\nWhen you submit a delivery order, it's sent directly to our courier team and restaurant crew, so it can get cooked up and on its way to you. That makes canceling orders sort of a challenge. If you really must cancel, and you've ordered directly through our app or online, reach out to our Customer Service team through the Contact Us page. If you ordered through a partner, check your confirmation email to contact their team directly. Keep in mind that you may incur a cancelation fee.\n\nWhat if my delivery order is inaccurate?\n\nDid you place your order through us by using order.chipotle.com or our app? Our bad. Please get in touch with our customer service team through the Contact Us page.\n\nCan I modify my order after it's been submitted?\n\nSince our first priority is making sure there's no confusion around what your order is or where it should be going, we (sadly) aren't able to accept modifications after delivery orders have been submitted. Our delivery partners have the same policy.\n\nDoes Chipotle deliver our food if I order through their online order website or mobile app?\n\nYep. We partner with DoorDash's delivery team to fulfill delivery orders placed through our website and app.\n\nDo you partner with additional delivery companies other than those listed on Chipotle.com?\n\nWe only work with partners that we know are able to provide Chipotle-quality service and deliver your order the way it deserves (AKA in style).\n\nAre there additional delivery costs?\n\nWhile your burrito should cost the same as it does with non-delivery orders, you may see a delivery fee, a service fee, or a minimum order amount. The fees also vary by partner. Just think of it as a small price to pay for getting deliciousness delivered to your door.\n\nIT'S FUN TO GET REWARDED\n\nThe best way to FREE Chipotle\nJoin Now Learn More about our rewards program \nHigh Protein Menu\n\nFrom the New High Protein Cup to the Double High Protein Bowl, Real protein never tasted so good.\nExplore More Applicant Privacy Notice California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Consumer Health Data Notice Terms of Use Cookie Policy Privacy Center Privacy Policy, including California Privacy Rights Your Privacy Choices",
