Pleasant’s trusted source for quality fresh juices and smoothies.\nFAMILY ROOTS \nIn the spring of 2013, Mt. Pleasant residents Anthony and Dana Collins were eager to start a new business venture. Dana had been a stay-at-home mom and had recently finished up a Biology degree at the College of Charleston, while Anthony worked in logistics. Their oldest daughter Erika was about to graduate from the College of Charleston and their sons Griffin and Ethan were starting their freshman year of college and high school respectively. Anthony, who had always been passionate about nutrition, found a listing for a locally-owned juice bar. He immediately knew that it would be the perfect way to invest back into the Mt. Pleasant community that they loved. With Erika and Dana helping lead the charge, Anthony’s family became the proud owners of The Main Squeeze ®.\n\nWith a focus on improving health and fostering long-term relationships with customers, The Main Squeeze soon became a favorite around town. Griffin, Ethan, and many more enthusiastic employees soon joined the team and continue to help the business grow and promote healthy living.\n\nThe Collins Family\nTHE MAIN SQUEEZE DIFFERENCE \nEverything on our menu is made to order. Freshly pressed juice quickly unleashes vital nutrients to your body. Our Classic and Signature smoothies check all the marks when it comes to health benefits, taste, and caloric content. We always use whole fruits and vegetables, which retain fiber and help cleanse your digestive system.\nWe use whole fruits and vegetables for every drink, without any added sugar, syrups, or other fillers. \nWe are happy to work with you on your dietary needs and can customize your drinks in many ways. Enhance your smoothie with freshly juiced apples or oranges, add a plant-based protein powder, or reduce natural sugars by swapping out the juice in a smoothie with almond milk.\n\nHungry for something to eat?
