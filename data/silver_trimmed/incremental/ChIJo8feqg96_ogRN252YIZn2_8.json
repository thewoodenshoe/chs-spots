The first and only steakhouse in Highlands, Oak partners with area purveyors and neighboring farms to bring the flavors of Appalachia right to the table.\n\nGuests will enjoy a variety of starters, entrees, sides, and more, including Venison Wellington with mushrooms, pearl onion, prosciutto, and celery root puree, Sunburst Farms Trout with carrots, squash, caramelized cippolini, pepperonata, and gremolata; and, of course, a selection of Certified Angus Beef steaks.

The menu features creative touches on classic libations. Guests are encouraged to enjoy their beverages “on the rocks and under the stars” on the property’s outdoor patio, which overlooks the lodge’s stone terrace and overhears the sounds of Big Creek Falls and Laurel Falls just below.\n\nIn addition to Oak, Skyline Lodge’s central lobby bar features expansive lounge seating, vaulted load-bearing ceilings, and two large scale fireplaces of hand-carved, locally quarried granite, and offers mid-century favorites such as Corpse Revivers, Manhattans, and Whisky Smashes as well as contemporary riffs on classics—nodding to the property’s 1960s roots.\nAbout Skyline Lodge Upcoming Events \nBe the First to Know\n\nGet insider access to Oak Steakhouse.
