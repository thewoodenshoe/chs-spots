Pretty small restaurant, expect to wait a bit for a table. Food is good & service is efficient - you'll be in and out pretty quickly! Solid pre-beach breakfast ”\n\n- Natalie M.\n\n“ Good was excellent. So many choices. We got several items and split to have a taste of everything. Service was quick and friendly! Patio was cute and reminded me of sitting in grandmas back porch. ”\n\n- Shawna B.\n\n“ This spot in downtown Digby NS was quite the find! Great atmosphere and great food! At our table of four we ordered two haddock chowders and two cheese and chicken soups which were all flavorful and delicious. We also got our soups with a half sandwich which ranged from tuna to egg salad to ham. I had the ham, which was also great! We did not end up ordering dessert, but I did tack on a latte which was balanced and well prepared as well. A great spot in Digby, do not miss! ”\n\n- Kerrie D.\n\n“ I brought the family here for an early morning breakfast. We got there when it opened so it was not busy and we waited just a minute to be seated. The menu is vast and you certainly can choose something that you like. The service was very good and the restaurant was clean. Blueberry walnut French toast was amazing. I heard it was a local favorite and it certainly is delicious. All the menu items we ordered were very good and I highly recommend stopping here but try and get here early to avoid the later crowd. ”\n\n- Rob S.\n\n“ Words can't express how much I loved this spot! We were looking for a dog friendly place with a good menu. When we pulled up, it was a quaint little restaurant with plenty of parking because most people walked there. We got a dog friendly place with a fantastic menu. After seating us, the immediately brought my pup water. So much so that we drove back a second day to eat what we didn't order the first time. They are cash only and have a conveniently placed ATM. This restaurant has turned into a staple for whenever we return to IOP. ”\n\n- M J.\n\nToday's Suggestions\n\nExplore the featured selections!\nDiscover Full Menu \n458\n\nReviews\n\n4.8\n\nRatings\n\n50\n\nin Menu\n\n328\n\nPositive Reviews\n\nAbout\n\nSea Biscuit Cafe\n\nSea Biscuit Cafe, located in Isle of Palms, SC, is a charming coffee and tea spot that also serves American-style breakfast and brunch.
