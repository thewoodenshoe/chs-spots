This restaurant came up with great reviews so I decided to give them a try. I'm sooo glad I did! I ordered the curry goat and it was so DELICIOUS. I didn't have to add salt or pepper to my food. It was very reasonably priced and I will definitely return! Service was fast and friendly!\n\nReview by - Google\n\nDynamic D:\nfive star review by \nWonderful atmosphere and people.
