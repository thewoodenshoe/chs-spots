Got a couple of drinks and appetizers and everything was AMAZING! We got fried macaroni, cheese sticks and fries. All so good along with the drinks! Service was great as well! It's more of a dive bar compared to the more high end places in the area which I actually prefer! Also super clean! Definitely recommend!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nAnn C:\n\nMac's Place is exactly the kind of place that makes you feel right at home! Especially if you are visiting from the Midwest:) Had a few drinks, watched some football and had the absolute best pretzels and cheese, hands down! They also have wireless phone chargers built into the bar!!!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nMelissa S:\n\nWe liked this place so much we went two nights in a row. Great hip hop music playing and awesome bartenders. It's not expensive to drink here either. Just a great vibe, easily one of my favorite stops in Charleston.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nGuy T:\n\nThis place is the definition of Bar. In Charleston for our honeymoon and came here to watch the NBA finals. Great place really love the decor and the vibe. Highly recommend if you're a dive bar kind of person which we are. Wish more places were like it. If I'm ever back in Charleston I'll make my way back to mac.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nAbby A:\n\nAwesome Chicago themed bar in Charleston!! The decor is fantastic and is the same as Chicago bars from back home! The Irish nachos are a must! The chicken tender wrap is also very tasty, lots of good wing sauces to choose from. There is also a lot of good table sizes for various party sizes which is nice! A must see if you're from Chicago!!!\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel enjoy! \nIn the meantime, have fun exploring a 'not so traditional' Irish Pub filled with various activities, games, with 14 flat screen televisions, you can find any sporting event you are looking for!Drinks and food specials are always available during the game of Chicago Football.\nspecials view our specials \nwe look forward to seeing you!\n\nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n215 East Bay Street\n\nCharleston, SC\n\n29401\n\nHours\n\nSunday - Thursday 12:00 pm - 2:00 am\n\nFriday - Saturday 11:00 am - 2:00 am\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page Yelp page \nContact us\n(855)-681-7076 info@macsplacecharleston.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
