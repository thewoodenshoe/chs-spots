From Uber eats delivery was on time and food was hot. The food was really good! The rice was tasty. The calamari was delicious. Tempura shrimp...there wasn't enough! So good. Gyoza- dumplings looked so good and nicely brown. All in all the food was really good and we will be ordering again.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nJessica B:\n\nTook my friends visiting town and we had a great experience! Service was fast, and every server was nice and attentive - we agreed they were our best servers since the pandemic began. We got the salmon hibachi dinner, NY strip hibachi dinner, shrimp yaki udon, and the crunchy crab maki roll. One of my friends asked for the miso soup instead of the house soup, but we all liked the house soup better.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nNick D:\n\nI go to Wasabi at least twice a week for lunch and their dinner is always fantastic also. I've tried numerous items on the menu and no matter what I get, it's always hot, well cooked, and tastes amazing! Love it here.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nAnnamaria B:\n\nHow I've not been here I just don't know. My fiancé and I had some time to grab some dinner before a concert and this seemed like the perfect spot to fill our recent cravings for some sushi. They have an awesome happy hour menu that goes until 7pm. Such a good selection of apps and rolls. We tried three, the California, spicy shrimp and crunchy crab. They were so good...\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nLeisa R:\n\nThis is my grandson's and my favorite eatery! We love coming here for sushi and the quiet, peaceful atmosphere. Awesome! Our only wish is that it was open for lunch on Saturday's. But, work our plans around that. Highly recommend Wasabi of Daniel Island.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n194 Seven Farms Drive\n\nCharleston, SC\n\n29492\n\nHours\n\nMonday-Friday 11:30am-2:30pm, 4:30pm-9:30pm\n\nSaturday 4:30pm-9:30pm\n\nSunday CLOSED\n\nFind us on...\nTwitter page Facebook page Instagram page Yelp page \nContact us\n(843)-388-8828 info@wasabi-di.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
