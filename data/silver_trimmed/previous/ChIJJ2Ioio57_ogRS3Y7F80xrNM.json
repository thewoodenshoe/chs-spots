Since we love making adjustments as we go, menus are not available prior to checking in for your reservation.\n\nWe will always accommodate reasonable dietary restrictions to the best of our ability based on availability of product and with advanced notice.\n\nPlease let us know of any food allergies or dietary restrictions when making your reservation.\n\nOur doors are open to everyone, but please keep in mind that you will be dining with the chefs. Please consider some content to be rated TV-MA and may not be words you want your kids to hear…\n\nPrepare to get brunched in the face!\n\nAre you ready for brunch R Kitchen style?! Check out the new pop -up event Reckless breakfast every Sunday morning at our West Ashely location with Chef Chris Seeley\nLearn more",
