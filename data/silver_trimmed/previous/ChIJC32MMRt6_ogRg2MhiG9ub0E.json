From the location right across from Battery park, to the kind and accommodating staff, this inn felt like luxury personified.\n\n- Christopher\n\nGoogle\n\nWe loved this property for many reasons. All the staff we encountered were extremely gracious, helpful and professional. Our room was a suite. We each had a bathroom and separate closets as well. The antique four poster bed was large and comfortable. Our room opened onto the large and very quiet back garden. The property is filled with fine genuine antiques befitting a home of its kind. We enjoyed our breakfast every morning. All in all we considered it a privilege to be able to reside in this special location right on the Battery in Old Charleston. We are very grateful that Dr. Schaeffer bought and restored this fine place to share with those of us who truly appreciate the opportunity to experience Charleston’s delightful culture and past first hand.\n\n- Janet\n\nTripadvisor\n\nWe just spent 4 fantastic nights at 20 South Battery and can't say enough good things about our time there. The mansion is a spectacular historical building and we felt very privileged to be able to see all of the beautiful furnishings and artwork along with getting a private tour of the building with Molly one afternoon. All of the staff there is ready to serve you with a smile. We stayed in one of the lower ground floor rooms and loved the peacefulness and privacy. There is so much to do and see within walking distance or just a short drive away. I would highly recommend staying here - you will definitely get 5 star treatment and truly feel like you have experienced Charleston in the way it was meant to be.\n\n- Margaret\n\nTrip Advisor\n\nDo you want to have the real southern charm experience? Do you want to feel what Charleston is really like? This is the place to start. As soon as you walk in the front door you are taken back to the Antebellum heyday. I do a lot of research before I make my final lodging selection. I have rarely been disappointed and usually my choices are all close to a perfect match. This Inn was as close to perfect as you can get. I particularly love the ambiance of the communal breakfast experience. It is the perfect place to meet new people and share favorite destinations. And don’t forget to take the tour of the house. This house has stories.\n\n- Gary\n\nGoogle\n\nExceptional historic home turned B&B in the most heavenly little spot in Charleston! Staff were warm and welcoming with quick and easy check-in and checkout. We were guided on a lovely tour of the home as well (highly recommend this if time allows). The room was spacious and updated; extremely comfortable bedding was a major plus after a long travel day. It was a joy to sit on the front porch in the morning while enjoying the ocean breeze, watching horse drawn carriages trot by, and seeing all the visitors to come to see the beautiful park. This is truly a wonderful place to stay and one of few opportunities to stay in this area of the city; highly recommend 20 South Battery!\n\n- Jill\n\nExpedia\n\nWhat a romantic stay in a spectacular location! The service was way above expectation. We were simply dazzled! The owner's preservation efforts were extraordinary, the property was made lavishly comfortable for guests, and the opportunity to \"live\" in an historic home that helped shape Charleston as we know it was an incredible treat.\n\n- Heather\n\nExpedia\n\nStay in a Mansion on the Battery\n\nBook your room and step into history.\nView Rooms \nCharleston\n\nConnect\nEmail Email * Sign Up (843) 727-3100 info@20southbattery.com \n©2026 All Rights Reserved | 20 S Battery St, Charleston, SC 29401 | Made by\nRidge Media LLC",
