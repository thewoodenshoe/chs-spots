The place is solid in every aspect and they have gotten better each year (free hush puppies instead of boring bread etc)...\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nStephan C:\n\nNothing comes close to the water view you get from the Boathouse. Sitting in their \"Crows Nest\", our bartender was Will. A great asset to this restaurant. He made me a great manhattan! Suggested a special they had. Seared Ahi tuna. Perfect! Rumor has it their hush puppies were the best.... it's no longer a rumor. These were perfect!!! Served with a flavored butter. Yum!!...\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nTim H:\n\nCome here every year! Great seafood! Nicole our server was wonderful. She even listened to one of my boring stories!!!! Food was great.. unfortunately the dolphins were not jumping this year..looking forward to next year!!Give this place a try!!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nKathy J:\n\nThis is our 3rd time in one week over our vacation that we have had dinner at the Boathouse! We were thrilled that the beach house we rented was walking distance and you cannot beat the service & fresh fish served at this great restaurant!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nBilly E:\n\nThe rooftop bar is great! We watched the fireworks here on 4th of July and you could see all the fireworks from all around. We had dinner before and I didn't expect much since the 3 star rating, but the food was great. Prices were great too! Valet is a plus...if definitely go back.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n101 Palm Blvd\n\nIsle of Palms, SC\n\n29451\n\nVisit our sister restaurants\n\nHours\n\nRooftop Bar Hours - Drinks and Appetizer\n\nOpen at 3 pm Daily\n\nHappy Hour - Bar ONLY\n\nMonday - Friday 4 pm - 6 pm\n\nDinner Hours - Full Menu\n\nSunday - Thursday 5 pm - 9 pm\n\nFriday - Saturday 5 pm - 9 pm\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page \nContact us\n(843)-886-8000 manager@boathouserestaurants.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
