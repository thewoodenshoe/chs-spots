This means that each beef cut has been verified 100% to be of USDA Prime quality, and aged to our exacting standards. Our proprietary aging process yields a minimum aging cycle of 42 days on all beef cuts, with the exception of our center cut New York strip, which is aged 50 days.\n\nA Fitting Finale\n\nFine food deserves an ovation, so we believe dessert is a course all its own. Grill 225's Executive Pastry Chef Gerry Elliot has overseen the Hotel's confections since the beginning, and he has designed Charleston's most extensive menu of divine desserts.\nHis signature creations include Baked Carolina - a popular dessert that is flambéed table-side and served family-style - and Banana Bread Pudding served warm with caramel sauce and caramel ice cream. The dessert course is thoughtfully prepared and artistically presented, a fitting finale to a masterful meal.\nDessert Wine Dessert Wine Download Dessert Selection Dessert Download Reserve a Table Hotel Reservations Grill 225 Reservations Information Request Events \n© Copyright 2026 Market Pavilion Hotel - All Rights Reserved.\n\nDesign by Palas Software Systems\nAccommodations Grill 225 Pavilion Bar Events Gifts Contact Policies Careers Top",
