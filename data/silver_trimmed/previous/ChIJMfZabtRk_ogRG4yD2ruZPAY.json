The tarter sauce is an excellent blend. It has a touch of sweetness. I will definitely be taking this drive again.\n\nReview by Google\n\nRenee O.:\n\nHidden gem for sure! English fish & chips with the BEST tartar sauce I’ve ever had. It’s very light, creamy and savory with a nice amount of dill. (No tangy pickle relish jarred tartar sauce here!) The staff was super nice and the food came out quick and piping hot.\n\nReview by Google\n\nDeborah S.:\n\nThis was the best fish, chips, curry sauce and smashed peas! It was a very popular stop and we are grateful it was our first stop after arriving in town! The fish was crispy and cooked to perfection. The portion was exceptional and the curry sauce or chip “gravy” was delish! Enjoyed every morsel!\n\nReview by Google\n\nAndrea N.:\n\nThis place is fantastic!!! The service was top notch! And the food was even better! When they say proper fish and chips they aren't lying! Perfectly cooked and huge portions! I would 100% recommend this place and go back if I am ever in the area. We ordered the World Famous Fish and Chips and the fish sandwich.\n\nReview by Google\n\nJustin B.:\n\nGreat experience, as usual. I've been here several times and try to drop in any time I'm in Charleston over lunch. Good food and friendly staff. Highly recommend it.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n4254 Spruill Avenue\n\nNorth Charleston, SC\n\n29405\n\nHours\n\nSun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat\n\n11:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n\nFind us on...\nInstagram page Google page \nContact us\n(843)-789-4649 \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
