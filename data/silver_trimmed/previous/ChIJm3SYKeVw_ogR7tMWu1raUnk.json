With wide open views of Shem Creek and the Charleston Harbor, Vickery’s is the Lowcountry’s quintessential, waterfront dining experience! We offer a shaded, outdoor deck, floor to ceiling glass windows for indoor dining, and outdoor picnic tables and seating along the marsh and dockside. Be ready for big plates of Cuban inspired southern favorites, fresh seafood, specialty salads, sandwiches and more. Taste and savor a specialty cocktail or one of our featured wines. If you’re looking for a cold beer, visit our main bar upstairs or the two outdoor bars—Muddy's Dock Bar and the Shark Fin. During the warmer seasons we offer live music at Muddy’s with fun drink specials. Vickery’s is a great place for the entire family, featuring a fun kid’s menu, and leashed dogs are always welcomed at Muddy’s. So welcome everyone! Enjoy everything Vickery's has to offer and be sure to catch some truly amazing sunsets—they never disappoint. We look forward to seeing you on the Creek.\nOur menu Join our dream team! \nSend us your resume!\n\nTaking the next step in your career?
