This place is unlike anything in Charleston and a true oasis in the city. If your looking for a beautiful place explore health and wellness this will soon become your home away from home. I absolutely love their yoga offerings and regular member events. From sound baths to pool side HIT classes The Wonder has something for everyone and I can honestly say I leave a better person after every visit.\" \n- Emily\n\n\"Amazing and unique concept that was missing from Charleston. The events I have attended have been well put together from the pool parties to the formal events. Staff is very friendly and food/drinks are great!\" \n- Joe\n\n\"My wife and I have stayed at some of the nicest resorts and hotels both in the Charleston area and across the US. The Wonderer equals any of those places. The pool, ambiance, and - most importantly - the service are all exceptional. You are not just a room number at the Wonderer. The staff are all incredibly friendly and warm. What a fantastic job they have done!\" \n- Michael\n\n\"Visiting Charleston for work and visited as a guest of a member. Tested out one of their fitness classes - it was excellent. The coaching was really on point and the small amenities like the cool towels and cucumber water made it all that much better. Grabbed a coffee and sandwich at the pool bar after, that was equally good. The staff was really cordial. Overall, a very pleasant experience and I plan to join when the 2nd region of my business gain more traction. Keep up the good work y'all!\" \n- Brian\n\n\"This place is amazing. An oasis in Charleston. The drinks, food and atmosphere are next level. I have loved every event I have attended from comedy shows to music acts they do it right! I wish I would have gone before I booked my wedding venue because it would be perfect for the ultimate party!\" \n– Rachel\n\n\"Have been able to enjoy most of the amenities offered at the Wonderer, and have nothing but positive feedback. I’ve utilized the work space and loved it. I also have attended several shows there. The venue is incredible, and their ownership is bringing in acts that I love but have never seen booked in Charleston. Kudos to the Wonderer for creating an oasis in the middle of downtown Charleston!\" \n- Peter\n\n\"This place is amazing. An oasis in Charleston. The drinks, food and atmosphere are next level.
