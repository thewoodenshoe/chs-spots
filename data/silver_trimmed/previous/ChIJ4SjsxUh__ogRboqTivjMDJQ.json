Local IPA was great, but IPA from MI was slightly oxidized - though a wonderful option on the menu to try. Lovely outdoor patio. Inside felt like you are drinking with friends in your living room. Great staff, can't wait to come back.\n\nReview by - Google\n\nBrad:\nfive star review by \nThis is a really enjoyable place to enjoy a glass of wine. The meat and cheese boards are really great for the price and are beautifully decorated. The variety of wine is quite expansive, and staff knowledge is always helpful. There are so many different sitting areas including couches, patio areas, bar, and cafe tables. Taking a bottle to go is also great when we find a wine we like!\n\nReview by - Google\n\nChristae:\nfive star review by \nWe enjoyed our time here. We stopped by after dinner and immediately loved the atmosphere. We were immediately greeted and was able to choose our seating. We told our server our typical wine choice and he recommended two that we purchased and loved. It was quiet (but not too quiet) and a great date night stop. I even appreciated the clean restroom with a hook for my purse. I noted the female sanitary products in the bathroom. It's the little things 😉 A must visit!\n\nReview by - Google\n\nAnnie:\nfive star review by \nAmaaaazing wine bar nestled in Johns Island. There was a pop up winemaker from South Africa the evening I visited. He came around and poured the wines and told us about each. Super cool experience. Additionally the owner was incredibly educated on all things wine/cheese and made the best recommendations.
