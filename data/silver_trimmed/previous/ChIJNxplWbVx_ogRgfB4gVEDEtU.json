Best I have had in Charleston by far. Very good, great, scrumptious. People come here to dine from far away regularly -- that is how good it is.\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nKenny S:\n\nMy wife and I went to Naan tonight and we were not disappointed one bit! The restaurant itself is super cool and has a modern hipsterish vibe to it with a very cool bar right by the entrance. The waitstaff was super attentive with multiple people checking in on us at different times making sure everything was alright without being overbearing\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nHolli A:\n\nMy daughter talked me into eating here, as it was my first time ever eating Indian cuisine. I wasn't sure what to order so we just got the buffet. Everything I tried was really good and I was impressed.\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nJoanne B:\n\nWe ate dinner here and everything was amazing. We had Chicken 65 for an appetizer. It was full of flavor, tender and just a little spicy. We had Seekh Kebab and Dal Makhani. Both were tasty and perfectly prepared. The service was spot-on and the restaurant is so clean! Everyone was very nice. Also, order the garlic naan.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n915 Houston Northcutt Boulevard\n\nMount Pleasant, SC\n\n29464\n\nHours\n\nMonday to Thursday -\n\nLunch - 11.00 AM to 3.00 PM\n\nDinner - 5.00 PM to 9.30 PM\n\nFriday and Saturday\n\nLunch - 11.00 AM to 3.00 PM\n\nDinner - 5.00 PM to 10.00 PM\n\nSunday\n\nLunch - 11.00 AM to 3.00 PM\n\nDinner - 5.00 PM to 9.00 PM\n\nFind us on...\n\nContact us\n(855)-681-8694 gudla.maganti@gmail.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
