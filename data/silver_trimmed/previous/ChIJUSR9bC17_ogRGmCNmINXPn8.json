I even danced while I ate!\n\nReview by - Google\n\nMarica -:\nfive star review by \nIn the Charleston area, and looking for authentic Caribbean food comes to Caribbean Delight. Some of the best oxtail I have tasted in a long time, the rice and peas cooked to perfection. The curry goat was tender, and plantains were delicious. The staff was friendly and the food was ready quickly.\n\nReview by - Google\n\njason:\nfive star review by \nHad a taste for oxtails for so long I had to make the 1.5 hour drive. I ordered the large oxtail plate with cabbage, rice and peas. All of it was so delicious. I was full as a tick when I was done. I 100% recommend and will be back soon.\n\nReview by - Google\n\nThat W:\nfive star review by \nStopped by here about a month ago with a friend and at first I was skeptical but let me tell you the food was delicious.
