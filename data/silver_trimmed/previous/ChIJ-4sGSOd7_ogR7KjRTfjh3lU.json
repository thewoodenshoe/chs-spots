Since opening its doors in 2001, 39 Rue de Jean has become a cornerstone of Charleston dining culture. From its classic French fare to its lively bar scene and timeless brasserie charm, “Rue” has welcomed generations of locals, visitors, families, and industry friends. Now, in honor of a remarkable 25 years, the restaurant is rolling out a full calendar of celebrations designed to toast the past — and raise a glass to the next chapter. \nThroughout 2026, guests can expect:\n✨ Monthly Wine Dinners – Each month will feature a themed wine dinner spotlighting French regions, Rue de Jean favorites, and guest chef collaborations. Reservations will be limited for an intimate, elevated experience. 📸 “Rue Memories” Social Media Campaign – Guests are invited to share their favorite photos, stories, and memories from visits over the last 25 years. Submissions will be featured on Rue’s social channels — with giveaways and the chance to be highlighted in a commemorative end-of-year project. 🥂 A Bubbles Bell – Installed in the dining room, the Bubbles Bell will be rung at surprise moments throughout the year. When it rings, the entire restaurant will celebrate with a complimentary glass of bubbles — including non-alcoholic options — as a toast to 25 years of Rue de Jean and 25 more to come. 🎉 Fête de la Rue — April 2026 – This ticketed patio celebration will take over the restaurant’s patio and surrounding spaces for an afternoon of French street-festival magic: food and wine stations, live entertainment, specialty cocktails, and celebratory surprises. Mark your calendars for April 25th, tickets will go on sale in early March. 🍽 The Return of Lunch – In honor of the anniversary, lunch service returns seven days a week beginning January 12th , complete with a refreshed menu featuring guest-requested throwback dishes, modern French plates, and new seasonal offerings. Charleston is invited to celebrate the past, savor the present, and toast to the future — one glass of bubbles at a time.
