I am blown away by how good everything was. The yellow curry was amazing and the wings were my favorite. My husband loved the pad Thai and the curry poppers. I cannot wait to visit again.\n\nGoogle reviews\n\nHazel C. A:\nfive star review by \nThis is my second time here in a week. This time I brought my husband. We ordered the Thai boat soup and the red curry. Both dishes were exquisite and had plenty of meat. You can request the level of spice in your dish. They provide a tray of spices and seasonings on the side and their chili oil was amazing. We were extremely happy with the quality and quantity of food.\n\nGoogle reviews\n\nJonathan S:\nfive star review by \nThe best Thai food I've ever had. From the first bite onward my taste buds were in ecstasy. I got the Cashew chicken. From the peppers to the wonderful flavor of the chicken to the bites of pineapple and rice and cashews... Every flavor flowed together well. I recommend.\n\nGoogle reviews\n\nErin B:\nfive star review by \nDelicious food, very attentive and kind service (from the owner) and good ambiance. So glad to have great Thai food nearby! And they understand their ingredients, and most of the menu is or can be gluten free. Tried 1 app, 3 dishes, Thai tea and a yummy sticky mango rice and am quite confident I will have Thai way too often now.\n\nGoogle reviews\n\nRachel F:\nfive star review by \nLove, love, love this restaurant! I mostly get take out but have eaten inside quite a few times as well and the ambiance is awesome. It's very well decorated and just such a cute little spot. The food is definitely some of the best Thai I've had in Charleston. They have multiple levels of spice which is nice and very nice portions, but mostly the flavors and variety of things to choose from are just awesome!\n\nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n1975 Magwood Drive Unit T\n\nCharleston, SC\n\n29414\n\nHours\n\nMonday-Friday\n\n11am-3pm and 4:30pm-9pm\n\nSat-Sun\n\n12-9 pm\n\nFind us on...\nGoogle page \nContact us\n(843)-501-7167 Call us at jirasak025@gmail.com Write us at \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
