I absolutely love their pizza (home made crust!) we have gone multiple times, and everything has been outstanding. I love their gnoqui.\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nKelly F:\n\nGreat place for lunch. We had the spaghetti and meatball ($8) and chicken park ($10). Both were very good. Nice atmosphere and clean. Reasonable prices. I'll be back. Ravioli, soup and salad were great.\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nGerry R:\n\nWe have been here from NYC FOR 18 months and have been underwhelmed with the Italian food here Well tonight we \"came home\" and had an excellent meal served by a Pro! Bravo LIDI WE will be back!!!\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nTiffany C:\n\nThis is our favorite Italian spot in Charleston. Everything is made from scratch and cooked to perfection. The braised veal short ribs are to die for. Stuffed mushrooms, calamari, and sausage and pea fettuccine Alfredo are a must. And Don't forget the espresso martini for dessert! You won't regret visiting LIDI.\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nStephanie D:\n\nDropped by after a concert for a app and drink. Food was delicious and the drinks were on point! Quentin and Cody were great. Cozy atmosphere and the staff were energetic and professional! We will certainly be back!\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n901 Island Park Dr Suite A\n\nDaniel Island, SC\n\nHours\n\nLunch: Monday through Friday 11 am to 2 pm\n\nDinner: Wednesday through Monday 4 pm to 9 pm\n\nClosed on Tuesday Evenings\n\nHappy Hour Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday 4 pm to 6 pm\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page Yelp page \nContact us\n(843)-471-1597 info@ristorantelidi.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
