My mother and my beloved sister have always been my cooking inspiration. Both of them were always in the kitchen and filled my childhood with love for food. Pizza has always been traditional food in our home. We prepare it using a secret recipe, which has been passed down over generations. Fortunately, my job and passion are the same. Just working with an amazing team and cooking authentic Italian pizza with the best ingredients is the reason enough to be happy. ​ Your Giovanni See Our Menu ORDER TAKE OUT EAT HERE See Our Menu Reservations MAKE A RESERVATION Reservations Private Events FANCY A PIZZA PARTY?
