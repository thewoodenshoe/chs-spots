Try it with the bacon and a crab cake. It is a euphoric experience that cannot be replicated anywhere. I love the location and the atmosphere. Service is top notch and prices are great.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nMaggie G:\n\nVisiting Charleston and we were looking for a unique place to eat.

I can't say enough good things about this place. The service was superb, our server went above and beyond. I got the mac and cheese with short ribs on the side (suggestion from our server), it was amazing.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n1968 Riviera Dr Unit O\n\nMount Pleasant, SC\n\n29464\n\nHours\n\nMonday - Thursday: 11AM-9PM\n\nFriday & Saturday: 11AM-10PM\n\nSunday: 10AM-9PM\n\nWe are closed Thanksgiving Day & Christmas Day,\n\nFind us on...\nTwitter page Facebook page Instagram page Yelp page \nContact us\n(843)-884-1177 peter@thecravehospitalitygroup.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
