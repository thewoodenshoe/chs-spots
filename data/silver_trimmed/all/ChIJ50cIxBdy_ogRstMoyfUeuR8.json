They were super attentive to a food allergy in our party which I appreciate! We had cocktails at the bar while waiting and it is a great atmosphere with friendly and attentive staff. review by - Yelp Tyler U: Ate here for the first time after hearing they make the best Mac n' cheese around. Figured I'd be the judge on that one...... the Mac didn't disappoint at all. The Buffalo Mac and cheese was amazing. The pasta was a perfect al dente, each of the individual cheeses shined through... review by - Yelp Robert C: Life changing Mac and Cheese. What more do I need to say? Try it with the bacon and a crab cake. It is a euphoric experience that cannot be replicated anywhere. I love the location and the atmosphere. Service is top notch and prices are great. review by - Yelp Maggie G: Visiting Charleston and we were looking for a unique place to eat. My daughter is a picky eater, and this looked like a good place to try. It was awesome. They had some amazing unique dishes and a nice balance of more traditional things for the less adventurous. review by - Yelp Denny B: We are visiting the area for a few weeks and thought we would try it out. I can't say enough good things about this place. The service was superb, our server went above and beyond. I got the mac and cheese with short ribs on the side (suggestion from our server), it was amazing.
