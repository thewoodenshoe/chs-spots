Matt and Ricky met while working in the illustrious kitchen at FIG  in downtown Charleston in 2003. The pair spent the better part of a year forming the concept for a wood-fired pizza shop that would focus on local ingredients. In 2005 they flew the coop to start EVO. The first incarnation was a mobile wood-fired pizza oven – in other words, a fancy trailer – that they used for catering. Turns out, people really like fancy trailer pizza. It became apparent that the concept was ready for a brick & mortar restaurant, and they found a perfect home on East Montague Avenue in North Charleston, part of the up-and-coming Park Circle area. In 2007, EVO Pizzeria fired up its ovens for the public, and hasn’t stopped since. We come to work at EVO every day to bring fun, delicious food and drink to everyone who walks through our doors. We source locally and regionally because we’re proud to support our community. We cook with love because we love to cook. And who doesn’t love pizza?!",
