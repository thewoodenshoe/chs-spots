Meet The Team \"Our dining experience surpassed our expectations.\" It is well beyond time that the Michelin folks award at least two stars to Circa 1886. In our experience, it has met or surpassed that standard on every occasion. For 15 years. Thank you Circa, for so many truly memorable meals! Gail R. \"Top-notch dining experience\" What an amazing dining experience this was. Set in what was once the carriage house. Beautifully decorated and a lovely restful experience. Our waiter was superb (and we connected immediately with him as he is originally from the same state and area as we live). My husband and I each had the tasting menu. He had the Cooper Menu and I had the Ashley Menu. The food was absolutely top rate! If you want a quiet, elegant meal, I highly recommend Circa 1886. C6239KKmonicad | Nashua, New Hampshire | 4/30/23 \"Perfection!\" Husband and I had each of the 5-course tasting menus. The service all around was top-notch. Wine pairings were perfection, and the quality and quantity of food was amazing. Best meal.
