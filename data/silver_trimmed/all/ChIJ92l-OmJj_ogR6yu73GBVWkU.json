The food was amazing. Plenty of options for vegans and alternative diet people. I love it! Vegetarian options: I’m a vegetarian myself. The menu was like walking into a candy shop. There were so many options. Brussel sprouts, corn, green onions, spinach and so much more.\n\nReview by - Google\n\nKevin B:\n\nThe staff was so friendly and inviting, the food was prepared quickly and it's delicious! I got the brunch bowl (I subbed in goat cheese grits) and the it was jam packed with flavors, from savory bacon to sweet maple syrup...\n\nReview by - Google\n\nSonia D:\n\nI really enjoyed the Dirty Bird breakfast. I had fried pickles with it. My friend had the Park Circle and we tried the parmesan grits. They were really good. The biscuit was soft and delicious!\n\nReview by - Google\n\nAubrey X:\n\nVisiting this establishment and not partaking in one of the grit bowls is a sin. Intriguing flavors and hefty portions are the reasons I'd definitely return. The hospitality of the crew was the cherry on top.\n\nReview by - Google\n\nAngela V:\n\nWOW - came in & sat at the bar area, ordered the park circle ''peaches & cream.'' Grits asked for extra crispy bacon 🥓 ✔️, the biscuits were flaky w house homemade blueberry jam!...\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nLocation and Hours\n\n3438 W Montague Ave\n\nNorth Charleston, SC\n\n29418\n(854)-895-4748 \nTue, Wed, Thur\n\n8:00 AM - 2:00 PM\n\nFri, Sat\n\n8:00 AM - 8:00 PM\n\nSun\n\n9:00 AM - 3:00 PM\n\nLocations\n\n3438 W Montague Ave\n\nNorth Charleston, SC\n(854)-895-4748 \nHours\n\nTue, Wed, Thur\n\n8:00 AM - 2:00 PM\n\nFri, Sat\n\n8:00 AM - 8:00 PM\n\nSun\n\n9:00 AM - 3:00 PM\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page \nContact us\ninfo@gracegrit.com \nCobb salad bowl\n\nFried oyster salad\n\nIndoor dining area\n\nThe BLT Bowl\n\nAssorted dishes, top view\n\nAn assortment of dishes and drinks on a table with Chicken &...\n\nFried chicken and waffle\n\nSoft shell sandwich and fries\n\nPatio at night\n\nThe Brunch Bowl\n\nThe Harvest Bowl\n\nFamous Grit Flight\n\nThe Grit Counter North sign outside\n\nBar, beer tap\n\nHot Chicken Sandwich\n\nFried Basket with fried Flounder served with sauces, Fries and...\n\nFried Oyster Salad\n\nAssorted grit bowls lined up on a table, top view\n\nBeer taps\n\nDifferent kinds of dishes arranged on a table, top view\n\nShrimp n Grits\n\nBanana Pudding Sweet Corn Soft Serve, close up\n\nBack patio, seating area under trees\n\nPimento Cheese Hushpuppies\n\nRestaurant's chef, headshot\n\nOwners, a portrait shot outside\n\nBanana Pudding Sweet Corn Soft Serve\n\nExterior, back patio details\n\nVISIT OUR SISTER RESTAURANT\n\nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
