They have a big beautiful bar and cute bartenders. Plenty of seating inside and out. I can't wait for them to be completely done renovating the outside! they have so much room to make such a great space to hang out at! Food is also outstanding! I'll definitely be back here hanging out.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nKate R:\n\nLovely spot for a beer and burger! The outdoor seating is awesome! Little on the buggy side being so close to the marsh, but Mainland Container has citronella candles, bug spray and fans to help ease the little pesky flies! Beer is cold, burgers and fish are on point, and the service was attentive and courteous. And... they are pet friendly... this is our new go-to spot!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nDiego R:\n\nThe shrimp and grits was amazing. Shrimp tacos were delish, as were the hush puppies. The servers were very attentive. Food was hot. Drinks were cold and served fast. Venue is quaint, but its not cheap. But it is worth the price.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nKalea E:\n\nA group of friends and I tried this for Sunday brunch (as everything else in town and downtown had over an hour long wait) and we were VERY impressed! Awesome tater tots and brunch specials at reasonable prices! Very friendly service and fun shipping container downstairs! Highly recommended!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nMatthew G:\n\nGreat spot and great staff. Food is above average bar food, solid burgers and great duck fat fried tator tots. Outdoor patio has a nice coastal breeze. The converted shipping container to a bar is a nice touch.\n\nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n1528 Ben Sawyer Blvd\n\nMount Pleasant, SC\n\n29464\n\nHours\n\nNOW OPEN for LUNCH!\n\nThe Pickled Palate @ Mainland serving lunch upstairs, Wednesday-Saturday!\n\nKitchen Hours:\n\nWednesday | 11am-3pm, 4pm-9pm\n\nThursday | 11am-3pm, 4pm-9pm\n\nFriday | 11am-3pm, 4pm-10pm\n\nSaturday | 11am-3pm, 3pm-10pm\n\nSunday | 11am-9pm\n\nBar Hours: open late daily, midnight on weekends\n\nFind us on...\nSpotHopper page Facebook page Instagram page \nContact us\n(843)-936-6718 info@mainlandcontainer.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
