Our Story \"...there's something even greater: Southern soul.\" Learn More In the South, we pass down recipes like names and silver. We eat food grown and harvested from our own fertile fields. We cook, serve, and share with those we love. We smoke meats low and slow, grind corn, and turn sugar cane into magical umber syrup. On the farm, we learn that there’s something deep and essential about food. Something primal about rolling up your sleeves and digging your hands into living earth. Something about the delicious beauty of peeling shrimp on the dock–and Sunday morning grits. Something that speaks to the roots of things. At home, we learn how to nurture. We learn patience. We learn about the unity of work and pleasure. And we’ve come to understand that this way of life is one worth preserving –and celebrating with as many people as possible. Because beyond family, community, land, and culture, there’s something even greater: Southern soul. And it’s up to us to feed it. Shrimp & Grits. Yes & Please. Start your own Southern tradition with our delicious stone-ground grits and Tidewater Shrimp Sauce & Marinade. SHOP NOW Take Your Shrimp Up A Notch With Our Tidewater Shrimp Sauce.
