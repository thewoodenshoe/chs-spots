      "text": "In case you were wondering … You don’t know if you don’t ask, right? If we can’t answer it below, please contact us so we can further assist your curiosities and inquiries. We know a thing or two and are happy to help. Explore FAQ Our Gallery can accommodate a maximum of 50 for a seated reception, and up to 75 for a cocktail reception. Set-ups vary based on group size and we can get real creative with that! How many people can The Gallery hold? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and not everyone loves everything. We understand; however, artwork cannot be physically removed. As a plus, though, we do have pipe and draping available to rent for $150.00 (plus tax). Or feel free to bring in an outside vendor to provide draping services of your preference. I’m not a fan of the current artwork on display in The Gallery. Can it be removed? Valet parking is available to overnight guests at the hotel for $49 per night. For guests not staying overnight, there is nearby street parking and two parking garages within a short and lovely stroll of the hotel. How does parking work? Unfortunately, we do not. Do you have bus parking? Early check-in based upon availability. Late check-out is complimentary until noon based upon availability. Can we check-in early or check-out late? Ah… the key to things sounding and looking great for groups. You are welcome to rent A/V through the hotel or bring in an outside vendor of your choice at no additional cost. Can we bring our own A/V? The hotel does not offer storage for groups and assumes no responsibility for personal items brought into the function space. Any gift bags, decor, centerpieces, etc. may be brought to the hotel the day of the function (not earlier due to lack of ability to store all your lovelies). Likewise, no items may remain in the hotel function space longer than one hour following the function. If any items are brought to the hotel for a function prior to the day of the event or left in the event space after the conclusion of the event, a non-refundable storage and handling fee of $250.00 (plus tax) per day will be automatically applied to the group’s bill. So, definitely have a plan for drop off and pick-up, no matter how much fun is on the menu! I have items being shipped. How does that work? Why yes it is… and it’s complimentary in The Gallery and all hotel rooms. Is Wi-Fi available? Social groups can begin set-up three hours prior to the start of the event and will have one hour after the event to break down. Early access can be offered based upon space availability for an additional charge. Corporate groups can coordinate with the Sales Manager for set-up/break-down times. How early can I come in to set-up/break-down? All food and drinks must be purchased through the hotel… and you’ll be glad you did. It’s two LESS things on your plate to handle. Can we bring our own food/alcohol? You are fully covered here at The Vendue… The Rooftop is open daily for lunch and dinner. Revival is open daily for dinner service. Full bellied and well pleased, you’ll be. Also, both offer amazing drink menus, to boot. Pre-game, post-game… we gotcha. Do you have an on-site restaurant? Of course we are and are happy to do so. Just talk to your Sales Manager who will work with you and the catering team to offer specialty meals. Are you able to accommodate dietary restrictions? As is typical, we do require a deposit along with the signed contract that is based on the contracted spend of the group. The remaining balance is due at least 75 business days prior to the event. Your Sales Manager gladly will walk you through all of it. Do you require a deposit? If so, what is the deposit schedule like? Sure it is and way to make it easy! Approved direct billing application required. I would prefer to be directly billed. Is that an option? The question is what is there NOT to do here? You’re in a great spot. We are fortunately located in The French Quarter within walking distance of a slew of amazing restaurants, art galleries, shops, bars, ghost tours (right?), and all sorts of Charleston-esque activities. Make time for some more fun on top of your big event. Waterfront Park is a block from the hotel with access to the Water Taxi that can take you through the harbor to Patriot’s Point in Mt. Pleasant. You’ll definitely want the experience. The Battery and White Point Gardens is a 10 min walk, Rainbow Row is only 5 min, and Charleston’s City Market is just 2 blocks away. We’re happy to point you in any direction per your preference… just let us know your vibe. What is there to do around town? We hope we answered most of your burning questions, but if not… Contact Us Worth Noting Keep exploring. There’s more to discover. Featured at The Vendue – Charleston’s Art Hotel.
