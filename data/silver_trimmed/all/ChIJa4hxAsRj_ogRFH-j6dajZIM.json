Does Five Guys menu items contain MSG? There is no MSG added to our burgers, hot dogs, fries, seasonings or condiments. The only seasonings offered in our restaurants are salt and Cajun seasoning. Is the Five Guys veggie sandwich a veggie patty? Our veggie sandwich is not a veggie burger, but truthfully, it can be a mix of whatever you'd like. Choose any combination of our condiments and add cheese for an additional cost. Our standard veggie is a mix of peppers, onions and mushrooms with or without cheese. What is the best way to reheat leftover fries? Leftover fries are excellent reheated in the oven (or Air Fryer). According to Chad Murrell, one of the Five Guys, just pop them in a 350-degree oven for about 10-15 minutes. Also, give those leftover fries a try as hash browns, home fries, or even as the filling in an omelet. How many restaurants does Five Guys have? We have more than 1,800 locations in over 26 countries! Most of our restaurants are located in North America.
