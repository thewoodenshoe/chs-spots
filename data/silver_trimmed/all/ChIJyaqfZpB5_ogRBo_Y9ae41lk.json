We enjoyed the jalapeño Moscow mules, catfish bites, fried okra, and the entrees. Service was excellent and he (sad I forgot his name) was very personable. Definitely would come back when we are in town!!!!! review by - Yelp Charisse F: I love the service including the beautiful outside dining areas.
