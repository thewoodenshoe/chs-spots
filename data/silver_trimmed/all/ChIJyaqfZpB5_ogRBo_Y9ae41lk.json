We enjoyed the jalapeño Moscow mules, catfish bites, fried okra, and the entrees. Service was excellent and he (sad I forgot his name) was very personable. Definitely would come back when we are in town!!!!!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nCharisse F:\n\nI love the service including the beautiful outside dining areas. The customer service from the hostess, cooks, servers/ waiter was truly delightful. The rustic fish camp decor only adds to rich flavor of the local crafted beer and local ingredients...\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nLiz M:\n\nEllis Creek Fish Camp is a really cool seafood restaurant that has beautiful views of the water. I like the outdoor eating option and it is good to get some fresh air and a breeze while eating. I like the hushpuppies and fish options on the menu the best...\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nB C:\n\nThe best fried okra I've ever had!!! The grouper sandwich was perfectly cooked...not over done, hot and flaked apart the way perfectly cooked fish should! Beautiful marsh setting. Friendly attentive service...Great spot for an awesome low country meal.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nDave C:\n\nFirst time here, and it was OUTSTANDING!!
