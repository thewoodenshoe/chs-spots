We cannot accommodate individual platings.The prefix menu does not include tax, tip, or beverages. The allotted time frame for the meal is two hours.\nGROUPS OF 11+ \nDepending on the evening and the number in your party, your group will either be sat in the main dining room or in the private dining room. As this is not considered a \"buy out\" and there is no minimum fee included, we will be seating guests before and after your party. If you would like to stay for longer than the allotted two hours, an additional fee of $100 per fifteen minutes may be added to your check. If you would like a more leisurely dinner, ask us about buying out our private dining room.\n\nAnd again, for sake of easiness and all our servers mental well-being we add 20% gratuity to any table 8+.\nPRIVATE EVENTS \nFor groups larger than 16 a buy out is required along with food and beverage minimums.
