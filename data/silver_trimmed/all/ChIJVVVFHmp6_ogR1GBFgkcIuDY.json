Private Parties Reviews review by - Yelp Julie M: My husband and I had three nights in Charleston and we chose to eat here for two of our three dinners because it was that delicious! Everything we ate was delicious but our favorite was the cheese fries! We will definitely go back the next time we are in town. review by - Yelp Brian T: The food here is amazing. I am not a beer drinker, so I can't speak to the bar offerings. I ordered the chicken strips with their parm truffle fries. So delicious! The breading was crisp and flavorful and the fries were perfect! I recommend you check this place out. review by - Yelp Sebastian P: I live in Charleston and I love the new dispensary. The staff is amazing so helpful and nice. The food is very good and reasonably priced for king street. The happy hour is probably one of the best deals on the peninsula. All around wonderful bar/restaurant. review by - Yelp Heather E: I'm a local and Had a great time here! Nelson, the manager was very social and we appreciate his hospitality. Burgers were great. Outside bar is worth checking out. Great happy hour specials too! Definitely check it out review by - Yelp Whitney M: The pretzels are unlike any pretzel in a restaurant. They are crunchy and soft with a different type of salt. The beer cheese was good as well. The hamburger was a $6 special and worth every bit. Even the fries were perfect... everything was unique and delicious that we tried.
