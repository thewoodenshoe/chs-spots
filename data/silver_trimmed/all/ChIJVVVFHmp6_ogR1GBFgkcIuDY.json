Everything we ate was delicious but our favorite was the cheese fries! We will definitely go back the next time we are in town.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nBrian T:\n\nThe food here is amazing. I am not a beer drinker, so I can't speak to the bar offerings. I ordered the chicken strips with their parm truffle fries. So delicious! The breading was crisp and flavorful and the fries were perfect! I recommend you check this place out.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nSebastian P:\n\nI live in Charleston and I love the new dispensary. The staff is amazing so helpful and nice. The food is very good and reasonably priced for king street. The happy hour is probably one of the best deals on the peninsula. All around wonderful bar/restaurant.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nHeather E:\n\nI'm a local and Had a great time here! Nelson, the manager was very social and we appreciate his hospitality. Burgers were great. Outside bar is worth checking out. Great happy hour specials too! Definitely check it out\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nWhitney M:\n\nThe pretzels are unlike any pretzel in a restaurant. They are crunchy and soft with a different type of salt. The beer cheese was good as well. The hamburger was a $6 special and worth every bit. Even the fries were perfect... everything was unique and delicious that we tried.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nSunday brunch\nOur Menu \nLive music\nAbout us \nSports bar (NFL/college football)\nParties Dot slide navigation number 1 Dot slide navigation number 2 Dot slide navigation number 3 Dot slide navigation number 4 Dot slide navigation number 5 Dot slide navigation number 6 Dot slide navigation number 7 slideshow start stop playing \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n559 King Street\n\nCharleston, SC,\n\n29403\n\nHours\n\nMonday - Wednesday: 4pm - til close\n\nThursday - Sunday: 11am - 1:30am\n\n** holidays may effect these hours **\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page Yelp page \nContact us\n(843)-737-4284 info@kingstreetdispensary.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
