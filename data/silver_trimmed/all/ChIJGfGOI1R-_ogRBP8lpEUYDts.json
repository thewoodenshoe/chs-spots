Especially the hungry. Most of us are pretty familiar with the ins and outs of your average sandwich shop, however since 2013 The Southern General has been serving up the expected and much, much more. And trust us, it's well worth a taste.\nRead more about us \nReviews\nStart stop reviews carousel \nReview by - Google\n\nBelynda L:\nfive star review by \nWe had the Cuban with house made chips and cucumber salad and everything was delicious!
