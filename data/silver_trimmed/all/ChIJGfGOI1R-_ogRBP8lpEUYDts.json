Across the street from Minero and nestled in the corner of the shopping center on Maybank Highway in Johns Island, is an unassuming spot with a little something for everyone. Especially the hungry. Most of us are pretty familiar with the ins and outs of your average sandwich shop, however since 2013 The Southern General has been serving up the expected and much, much more. And trust us, it's well worth a taste.
