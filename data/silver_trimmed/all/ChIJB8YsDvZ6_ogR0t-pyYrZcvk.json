Each venue represents a passion for high quality with an attention to detail in both service and selection.\nInquire Now \nMain Dining Room\n\nWith its beautiful high ceilings, comfortable seating and exquisite flourishes, the Main Dining Room is an elegant and versatile space that has something for everyone. The Main Dining Room can comfortably seat 100 guests for a sit-down rehearsal dinner, or we can remove some tables and throw an unforgettable cocktail party for 150 guests. From our open kitchen where you can see our talented chefs hard at work to our bar boasting up to 48 taps and an encyclopedic array of spirits the Main Dining Room offers an elevated experience with no rain plan needed.\n\nThe Exchange\n\nThe Exchange is our breathtaking event space that boasts two levels of honeyed pine floors and walls. This exquisite space is perfect for a cocktail party with heavy hors d’oeuvres for up to 80 guests or a dreamy, seated dinner for up to 60 guests. This unique space is sure to have your guests talking about it for years to come.\n\nThe Entire Restaurant\n\nRenting out the entire restaurant includes all rooms available. It allows for rehearsal dinners to have a proper cocktail hour outside before guests come in for dinner. It also allows for up to 300 people to enjoy live music, order drinks at either bar, watch the sun set in the courtyard or even a bourbon bar in the Library room.  Perhaps best of all, onsite parking is plentiful.\n\nThe Library\n\nThe Library is a completely private, intimate rectangular room near the kitchen of the main dining room. It can seat up to 32 people comfortably and could hold up to 45 people standing. The Library has a wall of windows with velvet curtains that can provide as little or as much privacy as you’d like. The Library is the only event space with a television screen and AV capabilities making it ideal for corporate banquets. This room is the perfect spot for private dinners, happy hours, bridal/baby showers, lectures, wine/beer tastings, and much more.\n\nThe Bower\n\nThis open timber-framed structure is the ideal backdrop for a variety of events and parties. Long wooden community tables are available for seated dinners of up to 100 people. The space is also ideal for parties and functions that can overflow in the adjacent courtyard. The entire space allows for up to 200 people standing. The Bower is a super flexible space that can host parties ranging from a corporate happy to a 100 person seated dinner to a lively dance floor. The Bower has fans for summer days and industrial ceiling heaters for the winter evenings. Both sides of The Bower have optional screens for privacy and intimacy. The Bower is complete with a full walkup bar.\nInquire Now Reservations Order Online \nEmail Signup\nPlease, enter a valid first name First Name - Required Please, enter a valid last name Last Name - Required Please, enter a valid email Email - Required Submit Please check errors in the form above Thank you for signing up for email updates!
