Unreal amount of sides and everything is authentic. I am from Turkey and this is the closest I have gotten to our food. The Mediterranean Pizza is very very good, I highly recommend it. I have been to plenty of places that has Mediterranean food but by Far Samir offers the most options and variety. Don't think about it, just go here ASAP. The atmosphere is very authentic too. I love it here. I also had some stuff catered for an event and Wow! Amazing!\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nAsh J.:\n\nI go here for lunch at least 1-2 times a month, would prob go more if I lived closer!! Their food is always fresh and flavorful!! Even my coworker that is picky is obsessed with this place! So many vegan options! I am vegan, so I only took pics of the vegan options on the bar, but there's so much more!\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nHale P.:\n\nI love some authentic Greek food! I'm so happy I found this little gem. Veggie gyro was delicious and the spinach & cabbage salad was perfectly marinated.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n186 Seven Farms Dr Ste 500\n\nCharleston, SC\n\n29492\n\nHours\n\nSun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat\n\n11:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page Yelp page \nContact us\n(843)-377-8666 info@alibabacharleston.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
