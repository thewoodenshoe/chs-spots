Maryam as the “chief taste tester” grew such a love for her culture’s staple dishes like Biryanis, Karahis, Saags and Kababs, and through many hours spent in the kitchen, became a chef herself.Maryam and Raheel’s families both moved from Pakistan to Canada where the two met, and later relocated to the Lowcountry. The couple jumped at the opportunity to do a Pakistani popup at The Daily in 2019, capturing the hearts and stomachs of locals and visitors alike, before opening Ma’am Saab at Workshop the following year in 2020. Fast forward to today, and the power couple now has plans to open a restaurant downtown on Meeting Street very soon, while continuing to operate their fast-casual Pakistani street food concept Malika in Mount Pleasant Towne Centre!Street food is an essential part of everyday life in Pakistan. Maryam's fondest memories include going out with family and friends and visiting streetside cafe's (dhabas) enjoying chaats and biryanis.
