About us For any occasion 40,000 Square feet of ballroom, conference rooms, hospitality suites and more Charleston Praise From the folks we worked directly with to everyone we interacted with it was a TOP notch experience. Raynor Garage Doors Our meeting grew from 400 to 800 because of the draw of The Charleston Place. South Carolina School Boards Association I have been in the Continuing Education business for 25 years and have worked with many hotels. I have never had a better experience. American Motility Society Personable, not stuffy, five-diamond service. It’s a meeting planner’s dream since they are on top of everything. They are proactive and one step ahead of most other hotels. COBANK I have nothing but the best things to say about our experience. The customer service, food, and facilities were fantastic and our guests were extremely pleased with the accommodations. HUDSON AUTOMOTIVE I’ve been to many hotels, but never have I continued to reflect back on the professionalism and charm of the staff. FEDEX I literally haven’t ever been to a hotel where the fabric of the place just sang because of the people who just so obviously loved their own hotel and were so proud to work there. CONDE NAST TRAVELER Off-site events were great—the harbor cruise, plantation tours, carriage rides and Yorktown dinner were all spectacular. AMERIS Bank The program went on without any hitches and our Awards Banquet was knocked right out of the park… I truly appreciate all of you doing such an amazing job. It was flawless and well done.
