Got the potato flautas with bacon and cheese for an app. Had the pan seared sea scallops for dinner. Everything went so well together. Got a couple old fashioned drinks too. Everything was amazing and service was great.\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nFrank C:\n\nGreat place for food and drinks. Bartenders attentive and personable. Either inside or the outside dining and bar area. Owners are hard working and very cool. And a must to check out their lunch truck.\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nEllie K:\n\nEvery time we visit Charleston this is a must go dinner. It's always great and tastes fantastic!
