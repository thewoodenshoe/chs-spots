Smoked ribs were to die for! We got it on open music night and it was a blast. We are already planning to go here again. review by - Yelp Wendy R: Ribs delicious and huge. Brisket was outstanding. Wings were also very good. Nice atmosphere and quality service. Also had a great band so that added a star to the entire experience. review by - Yelp Ingrid J: GREAT BBQ...we smelled the BBQ lingering in the air that we had to stop. Thank God we did because this place has the BEST BBQ ever (and we live in Savannah)! Come by and I promise you, you will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! review by - Yelp Emily M: Brisket is super underrated. I think they've made some changes, and I'd put their bbq up against any others in town. The smoked wings are the best I've had. Love the atmosphere, and the live music. Good vibe, and awesome outdoor seating space. review by - Yelp George D: Holy cow, that was some good BBQ. Stopped by on a whim. Everyone really enjoyed the food. Wraps, potatoes, brisket, pulled pork, ribs. The coleslaw was fanatic also. You can't go wrong.
