Smoked ribs were to die for! We got it on open music night and it was a blast. We are already planning to go here again.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nWendy R:\n\nRibs delicious and huge. Brisket was outstanding. Wings were also very good. Nice atmosphere and quality service. Also had a great band so that added a star to the entire experience.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nIngrid J:\n\nGREAT BBQ...we smelled the BBQ lingering in the air that we had to stop. Thank God we did because this place has the BEST BBQ ever (and we live in Savannah)! Come by and I promise you, you will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nEmily M:\n\nBrisket is super underrated. I think they've made some changes, and I'd put their bbq up against any others in town. The smoked wings are the best I've had. Love the atmosphere, and the live music. Good vibe, and awesome outdoor seating space.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nGeorge D:\n\nHoly cow, that was some good BBQ. Stopped by on a whim. Everyone really enjoyed the food. Wraps, potatoes, brisket, pulled pork, ribs. The coleslaw was fanatic also. You can't go wrong.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocations\n\nWest Ashley\n\n2544 Savannah Highway\n\nCharleston, SC\n\n29414\n\nPark Circle\n\n1033 E Montague Ave\n\nNorth Charleston, SC\n\n29405\n\nHours\n\nWest Ashley\n\nSunday - Thursday 11am-12am\n\nFriday - Saturday 11am-2.am\n\nPark Circle\n\nMonday 11am-6pm\n\nTuesday - Thursday 11am-12am\n\nFriday - Saturday 11am-2.am\n\nSunday 11am-12am\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page Yelp page \nContact us\n\nPark Circle:\n(843)-974-4953 \nWest Ashley:\n(843)-212-5785 emilym@lucky17restaurants.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
