But when it comes to describing this property, truly think that words cannot describe what an awesome place this is for large families and groups. Had 21 people stay here and we all had accommodations that go over the top. Plenty of room for everybody and first class in every way. One amazing thing about this house is despite everything being luxurious, the house still has some of those touches that make it feel warm and welcoming. And the folks are Exclusive Properties are really friendly folks who balance good customer service with genuine caring about their guests. Thank you so much Exclusive Properties for making this one of the most memorable incredible get togethers ever for our family!! Rick There is not enough space to detail how much we loved our stay! Everything was perfect!! Simply everything! We want to return year after year— and Megan and team went out of their way for us'. Just an amazing weekend! Thank you so much! Mindy Our family vacation worked out perfectly as little children and adults all had their own room/baths which made for very happy people. Shelly and Megan were very responsive to a couple of issues and very delightful. Having the pool heated was a good choice for our group, having dinners catered spoiled all of us. Poe's (on Sullivan Island) is a favorite dinner choice of our group as is buying fresh seafood at Shem Creek. Susie Each summer we try to take our children and grandsons to a beach location and after many other locations we fell in love with Isle of Palms. The most important ingredient to our new love affair is this amazing home. It is incredibly clean and convenient with comfortable elegance. We have small grandsons and it is a perfect home for families. They enjoyed the pool, screened in porches and quick access to the beach, near by restaurants..kid friendly. The listing description is very accurate! And absolutely not a bug insight the entire week, coming from the north where we are not used to your local creatures, that was important to us! We will return to Isle of Palms and to this lovely home. Thanks to the owner for sharing with us. We created wonderful memories!
