It was so fresh and came with a baguette to dip in it. The wine stations were pretty awesome as well and improbably tried about four different wines...\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nLowanda J:\n\nDropped in for some wine after dinner. My guest was a regular so I felt like VIP when we entered. We were greeted with hugs and smiles and once they found out we were celebrating my birthday, they treated us to a toast of Prosecco! Such a sweet gesture!\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nCindy P:\n\nGreat HAPPY HOUR. Very good drinks but the SHE CRAB SOUP was AMAZING. The stuffed mushrooms were also very good. We came to town for 2 days and went to Uncork both days. Great staff. Thanks\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nPaige P:\n\nBrought my girls here for a fun night for my bachelorette and loved everything about it! We enjoyed the live music, fun drinks, boards, at beautiful atmosphere!\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nPamela H:\n\nFantastic! Terrific food- try the crostini with strawberries, goat cheese and basalmic glaze= delicious. Several seating choices, we selected the arm chairs. Super comfy. Nice selection of wines, giving you the option to have a one, three, or six ounce pour...\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n476 King Street\n\nCharleston, SC\n\n29403\n\nHours\n\nMonday: Closed\n\nTuesday - Thursday: 4pm - 10pm\n\nFriday - Saturday: 1pm - 11pm\n\nSunday: 11am - 8pm\n\nWeekly Deals and Events:\n\nWednesdays: $15 Pastas\n\nThursdays 7pm: Pop Culture Trivia (free to play)\n\nFridays 7-10pm: Live Music by Philip Blackstone\n\nSaturdays 7-10pm: Live Music\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page Yelp page Tripadvisor page \nContact us\n(854)-222-3939 info@uncorkchs.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
