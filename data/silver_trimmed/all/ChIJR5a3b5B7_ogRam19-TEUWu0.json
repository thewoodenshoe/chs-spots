Staff is very friendly and food/drinks are great!\" - Joe \"My wife and I have stayed at some of the nicest resorts and hotels both in the Charleston area and across the US. The Wonderer equals any of those places. The pool, ambiance, and - most importantly - the service are all exceptional. You are not just a room number at the Wonderer. The staff are all incredibly friendly and warm. What a fantastic job they have done!\" - Michael \"Visiting Charleston for work and visited as a guest of a member. Tested out one of their fitness classes - it was excellent. The coaching was really on point and the small amenities like the cool towels and cucumber water made it all that much better. Grabbed a coffee and sandwich at the pool bar after, that was equally good. The staff was really cordial. Overall, a very pleasant experience and I plan to join when the 2nd region of my business gain more traction. Keep up the good work y'all!\" - Brian \"This place is amazing. An oasis in Charleston. The drinks, food and atmosphere are next level. I have loved every event I have attended from comedy shows to music acts they do it right! I wish I would have gone before I booked my wedding venue because it would be perfect for the ultimate party!\" – Rachel \"Have been able to enjoy most of the amenities offered at the Wonderer, and have nothing but positive feedback. I’ve utilized the work space and loved it. I also have attended several shows there. The venue is incredible, and their ownership is bringing in acts that I love but have never seen booked in Charleston.
