The bartenders are amazing and the DJ/Music is on point. If you're looking for a more laid back, casual dance club I would recommend this place. Review by - Google Thomas W: five star review by Probably the best bar I have ever been to. Although it was crowded, the bartenders hustled to make sure we were taken care of. The live music was also unbelievable. John Mayer happened to be there and joined the band for two of his popular songs and then added Jimmy Buffet's 'Come Monday' for an encore. The crowd went wild! I'll never forget the night at the Silver Dollar! Review by - Google Kristen D: five star review by We came here for a bachelorette party. We were on our way to Republic but the music here was awesome so we popped in to check it out. It was awesome! The DJ was great and played music that kept the party going. Review by - Google Jolene L: five star review by We just had the BEST pierogis (we tried three kinds) fantastic! And we ordered the Lazanki. We LOVED it. The Silver Dollar is a bar with gourmet food served in take out. A hidden gem on King Street! I have never seen Polish food offered at a bar, but it beats nachos any day. Not to be a snob about bar food; they do offer sliders too!. Newsletter Location 478 King St Charleston, SC 29403 Jobs Party Boat visit website Find us on...
