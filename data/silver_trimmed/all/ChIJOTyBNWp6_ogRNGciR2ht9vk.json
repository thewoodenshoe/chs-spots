The bartenders are amazing and the DJ/Music is on point. If you're looking for a more laid back, casual dance club I would recommend this place.\n\nReview by - Google\n\nThomas W:\nfive star review by \nProbably the best bar I have ever been to. Although it was crowded, the bartenders hustled to make sure we were taken care of. The live music was also unbelievable. John Mayer happened to be there and joined the band for two of his popular songs and then added Jimmy Buffet's 'Come Monday' for an encore. The crowd went wild! I'll never forget the night at the Silver Dollar!\n\nReview by - Google\n\nKristen D:\nfive star review by \nWe came here for a bachelorette party. We were on our way to Republic but the music here was awesome so we popped in to check it out. It was awesome! The DJ was great and played music that kept the party going.\n\nReview by - Google\n\nJolene L:\nfive star review by \nWe just had the BEST pierogis (we tried three kinds) fantastic! And we ordered the Lazanki. We LOVED it. The Silver Dollar is a bar with gourmet food served in take out. A hidden gem on King Street! I have never seen Polish food offered at a bar, but it beats nachos any day. Not to be a snob about bar food; they do offer sliders too!.\n\nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n478 King St\n\nCharleston, SC\n\n29403\nJobs Party Boat visit website \nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page tiktok page Google page \nHours\n\nSun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat\n\n6:00 PM - 2:00 AM\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page tiktok page Google page \nContact us\n(843)-722-7223 Call us at steve@silverdollarchs.com Write us at Jobs Party Boat visit website × \nNewsletter",
