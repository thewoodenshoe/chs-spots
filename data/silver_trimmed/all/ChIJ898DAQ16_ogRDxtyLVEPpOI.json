This rustic bar is full of history and has seen more than its fair share of lore that has grown over the years. If walls could talk there would be no shortage of stories. Some fact and some fiction, and some aged like a fine bourbon that gets better with time. Ask us about Big John Cannady, who played for the New York Giants from 1947-1954, before opening Big John's Tavern in 1955, in his hometown of Charleston, SC.\nRead more about us \nReviews\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nMartha N:\n\nbest service! great food! fun people! local!
