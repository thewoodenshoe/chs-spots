Reviews Start stop reviews carousel Review by - Google Anthony T: five star review by Great little spot with a very tasteful menu. Checks a lot of the boxes for a typical foodie. When I am back in town I will definitely return. Review by - Google Meia M: five star review by Even as delivery, some of the tastiest and unique food in the area. Quality, fresh, worth the price. The sauces are obviously housemade and enhance each dish. Review by - Google Brad G: five star review by Enjoyed eating at Graze while on vacation. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and the food - lobster Mac n cheese, Citris chili short rib tacos - was delicious!
