      "text": "0 Welcome to Lost Isle. Nestled on Johns Island, we’re the island’s first fire-to-table restaurant and bar, located at 3338 Maybank Highway beside The Tattooed Moose! Our entire dining experience unfolds outdoors, tucked behind the building beneath a sprawling pecan tree and an open sky. Settle in by the glow of the fire, cozy up under the heaters, or wrap yourself in a warm blanket as the night settles in. Slow down, linger a little longer, and let the evening do the rest. We hope you find your vibe at Lost Isle! FAQ’s | We do have Handicap Accessible Parking & Seating | Rainy Day Policy - We Open Rain or Shine, but will announce on social media if weather hinders our operations | We do not take reservations - Come during the week to avoid wait times! | Dog Policy - We allow happy, healthy, well-behaved dogs who are on a leash and go potty before arrival | We do not have High Chairs or a Children’s Menu, but we cater to guests of all ages",
