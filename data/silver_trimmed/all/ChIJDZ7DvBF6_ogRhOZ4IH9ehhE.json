Simply Delicious. In 1982, three restaurateurs had the vision to provide a uniquely “Charleston” dining experience with a focus on fresh, local cuisine and gracious hospitality. They had the perfect setting consisting of three buildings and a garden courtyard nestled in the Historic French Quarter, but they could not agree on a name.

The staff was more than friendly upon our arrival. We didn’t have a reservation but I felt like it wouldn’t have been a bad idea to get one before we dined there. The food was amazingly delicious with tons of flavor. Never had She crab soup and it was amazing. Go ahead a treat yourself to a great southern style meal. review by - Google Sarah G: The food was delicious, & the presentation made the meal feel all the more special! The restaurant's layout is unique & takes advantage of the historic building it's in; the patio is cozy and inviting! I'm so glad we happened to walk by when we were looking for a nice place for dinner! review by - Google Michelle W: We went for brunch and loved everything we ordered! The place is super popular so make sure you make reservation well ahead of time. Shrimp and grits, crab cakes Benedict, French toast, jambalaya, fish and grits, all very delicious review by - Google April W: The ambiance was lovely. We sat outside on a beautiful day and got a great seat under the gazebo! Loved that. Our food was yummy! We tried the she crab soup which was nice. The bbq shrimp and grits were good. The star of the show was the chefs special that day though. The kids pasta and shrimp was delicious and our son liked his po’boy very much but I think he liked the homemade chips best. Our server was very friendly and great. review by - Google Tammy A: Beautiful decor and atmosphere for our anniversary. The food was simply delicious and larger servings than I excepted. We had She Soup, very good with lots of flavor. We shared the salad and then I had crab cakes, which were delicious!! Desert was a refreshing lemon and creme cake. Thank you for the great service!!
