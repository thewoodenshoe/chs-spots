Fresh-off-the-boat lobsters are flown down each Saturday from Vinalhaven, a small island located off the coast of Maine that is home to the second largest lobstering harbor in the world. All lobsters are one and half pounds and are perfectly steamed to order. They are served the Maine way with lemon, hot drawn butter and a variety of sides to choose from. Reservations are strongly suggested and quantities are limited. Come and enjoy the only whole steamed Maine lobster in the Low Country! 05:00 PM - 09:00 PM Tuesday January 20th Steakhouse Night • Steakhouse Night is overflowing with delicious cuts of meat, including Rib-eye.
