Staff was accommodating, helpful and welcoming. Location can’t be beat. Breakfast every day was complete perfection. This is an old inn & decor is period-specific. We loved it. Bathroom was modern and had amazing water pressure which for the age of the inn was a nice surprise! KCM | 4/12/25 \"Great Stay; Strongly Recommended\" We thoroughly enjoyed our three-night stay. This historic property is wonderfully maintained. Our room was very comfortable. The reception staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and genuinely an asset to the property. Breakfast staff is equally attentive and friendly. While all the staff is wonderful, the all star is the gentleman who handles luggage, does light maintenance and other tasks. Property is within walking distance to restaurants and most of the historic district. We did not need a vehicle when we were staying here, but they do have a parking area (added fee) for those that do. If we visit Charleston again, we will certainly stay here. Andy | 3/23/25 \"Wonderful stay\" Really enjoyed our 3 night stay here. The property was beautiful and in a historic area of town. We had breakfast served in our room every morning which was a treat! They offer delicious treats for afternoon tea. The concierges are so helpful - from fixing the tv sound, to getting more pillows and advising how to get to dinner. We stayed in the carriage house which worked well for us. Minimal stairs!
