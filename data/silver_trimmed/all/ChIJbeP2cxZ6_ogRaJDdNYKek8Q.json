The Wentworth Mansion thought of every tiny Detail. A lot of Bang for your buck. And there are not enough words to describe the level of service. They had a bottle of champagne in the room when we arrived, wishing my wife Happy Birthday. So thoughtful. Watson was extremely efficient. We plan on going back, the next time we are in the Charleston area. BlufftonLocal1 | 4/13/25 \"Continued Excellence\" From check-in to checkout, the experience is superlative with the historic facility being spotless, the staff happily going above and beyond and our room was fantastic. We have been to the Wentworth several times with different levels of room and all are marvelous. As highlighted by others the breakfast at the adjacent Circa 1886 is phenomenal and DO yourself a favor and visit Circa 1886 for dinner… you will not be disappointed. A glorious lodging experience. Conchobar | 4/5/25 \"Magical\" Brian and Mark's service was the best we have ever experienced—unbelievable. We felt like we were a guest in someone’s home. Everything was perfect. Every detail in the rooms was perfect, beautiful, and so big. The property felt extremely safe. It was walkable to most everywhere. The wine selection in the afternoons was wonderful. The concierge was better than anywhere we have ever been—it tops Paris, which was wonderful. Hotel highlights: luxury, great view, romantic, quiet.
