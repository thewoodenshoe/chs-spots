Even if liquor isn't your thing, it's still worth checking out. The mixed drinks are creative and well balanced. Don't miss this one. Google reviews TheAngryTeddyXL: Stopped in with my local friends while visiting from out of town. The liquor here is some of the smoothest spirits I've ever had. The atmosphere is wonderful, the tour was informative, and the staff was fantastic! Will visit here everytime I'm in town. Google reviews Brooke H: Cannon distillery has an amazing atmosphere and staff. Most of all, their vodka is the best around. Pour it straight or have it in one of their unique and tasty cocktails. No matter what you won't regret it. Google reviews Jeromy L: Great guys and descriptive on their process. Good bourbon and can't wait until their makes come out. Friends loved the cocktails, I'm a neat person. Great place, will make it back. Google reviews Joshua C: My wife and I stopped in here on our honeymoon and loved the place.
