It has such a cool underground kind of vibe, and everyone is laid-back and cool. There is both inside and outside seating, and because it was a nice night, we sat outside on a bench. Our server was a really nice guy and gave us great recommendations. We ordered some gator bites and some gumbo-style fries, and those were AWESOME... Review by - Yelp Ian-n A: five star review by In Charleston for a few hours decided to try Lola's out with my husband ...OMG so glad we did. Great food! Got the gator and raw oysters for appetizer. Gumbo, French dip, and fried oyster po boy for main course. Seriously in heaven ! My husband and I just spent 6 years off the mainland and this was a nice welcome back home to the south lunch... Review by - Yelp Brent L: five star review by Wow! Is what I have to say about this place. Came here on a whim and it didn't disappoint. I had the shrimp and crawfish etouffee and loved it immensely. Had great flavor and the portions were great. My wife had the jambalaya and that was great as well. They both came with this cornbread that was out of this world. I have never had such great tasting cornbread... Review by - Yelp Juli G: five star review by Did we get lucky. Best food in Charleston so far! Drive a little and get great Cajun food. We have eaten at other places so far and this is by far the BEST. The jambalaya was the great and the bread pudding was well worth the calories. Thr.servers were friendly and the owner wanted to be sure we had a good experience. We will come back!!! Review by - Yelp Joe D: five star review by Absolute must! The quaint building is bursting with flavor! Portions are nice, service is impeccable(great job Alison), and the food OMG, the food is fantastic. Cajun cuisine at its finest. I've been here a couple of times and each experience is consistent. The place is clean and very prompt. Great place for a quick lunch or date night. You have to try the swamp water!..
