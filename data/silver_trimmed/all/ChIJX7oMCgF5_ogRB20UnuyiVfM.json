Reservations Reviews Review by - Yelp Tim M: Family vacation- looking over casual atmosphere for steak. So we select Garage 75. And this begins a 5-star experience. Great service, great food, great appetizers, great drinks, great casual atmosphere. Actually the best meal my family has enjoyed this week on vacation in Charleston. The steak and potato were perfectly seasoned and to the perfect temperature... Review by - Yelp Krisina H: The food is beyond exceptional, and they offer specials through the week. I'm impressed by the arcade room. Overall, I'd give this place a million stars if I could. Perfect service. Colin and Evan are amazing bartending. They care a lot about employees and always made sure I was okay, and my drinks were full. I fully recommend this place and I'm definitely coming back.. Review by - Yelp Brandy A: Surf and Turf was wonderful. Wings were okay but should have gotten hot instead of mild sauce. That's my fault. Socially distanced on the picnic tables outside. Staff was friendly and worked to keep things sanitary. Would recommend if you're on Folly and don't want to deal with crowds and parking. Review by - Yelp Panayota E: This is our favorite local sports pub with arcade games and awesome food!! Especially late night menu is the shit! Best food for a bar, my husband loves the steaks and the wings, tenders, potato wedges, flat breads and salads are so good! Chelsea and matt are our favorite bar tenders!! Also there is mini bowling! Lots of arcade games and pool tables, perfect for bday parties you g and old. Review by - Yelp Max M: An interesting bar style restaurant in a roadside shopping center on Folly Road (on the right as you go out to the beach). We went there to hear a friend's two piece folk group (really good) and sat toward the back as there was a bit of a crowd, but plenty of parking spaces available. The menu (see my photo) is for flatbread sort of pizza choices...
