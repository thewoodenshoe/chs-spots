On weekends during the day or on Monday nights, guests gather around “the pass,” an open-kitchen counter where the chef prepares a three-course seasonal menu in front of the group. Past dishes have included heirloom tomato caprese with burrata balloons, steamed bass with ramp butter and truffles, and chocolate pot de crème with caramel honeycomb. Each course comes paired with wine and served as it’s completed. At $235 per person, the experience is capped at eight guests and booked through Resy, offering equal parts instruction and chef’s-table theater.” Read the feature on Food & Wine Share this post - Opens in new tab. - Opens in new tab. - Opens in new tab.
