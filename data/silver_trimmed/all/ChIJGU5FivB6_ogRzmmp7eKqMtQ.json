The EOBC kitchen is known for approachable, innovative food from around the world via acclaimed Executive Chef Alex Yellan. The bustling production brewery situated behind the taproom distributes beer to 11 states (and counting) in cans and kegs.\nStart Planning About The Space \nThe Astroturf Lawn next to the brewery can be tented to accommodate ceremonies, receptions, fundraisers, and more. The Lawn allows for up to 200 people and would require tent(s) rental. The entire Pacific Box & Crate campus can be rented as a whole for events up to 1,000 people. For smaller, not-so-private dinners, sections of the taproom can be reserved for celebrations and meetings. The Taproom can hold up to 225 people in its entirety and includes a large full bar plus a rectangular patio.\nStart Planning Arrow Icon An arrow icon Arrow Icon An arrow icon Explore Our Beers FAQs",
