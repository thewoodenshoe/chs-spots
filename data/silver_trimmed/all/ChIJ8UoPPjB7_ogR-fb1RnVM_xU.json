Was looking at Big Breakfast down the street and it was super packed. Saw this hidden gem and brought my 9 year old daughter for a quick brunch. Quick and easy free parking. Crazy good brunch food...\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nSunny K:\n\nLove the vibe and service here. Friendly but not pushy. Great hamburgers and always have the games on tv. Hello from a fellow New Yorker!\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nLucas A:\n\nGreat spot for having a beer and grabbing a bite. The food is spectacular and very reasonably priced for the quality you receive. Nice ambiance and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. I also respect that they have Guinness on tap along with Guinness glasses...\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nAmy B:\n\nSitting at the bar is like sitting down at owner Brandon's home. The service is awesome. Get the burger- perfectly cooked, juicy. It doesn't try to do anything that it's not. It's just an awesome burger cooked to perfection.\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nVas K:\n\nGreat food and excellent service. Our group of 6 thoroughly enjoyed every dish. Highly recommend this new addition to Charleston.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n430 Meeting Street\n\nCharleston, SC\n\n29403\n\nHours\n\nMonday - Friday\n\n11 AM - 1 AM\n\nSat & Sun\n\n9:30 AM - 1 AM\n\nDecember 24th & 26th\n\nOpen 4 pm - 1 am\n\nChristmas December 25th\n\nClosed 10 am - 3:59 pm\n\nOpen 4 pm - 1 am\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page Yelp page \nContact us\n(843)-577-9312 bedfordfallschs@gmail.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
