Was looking at Big Breakfast down the street and it was super packed. Saw this hidden gem and brought my 9 year old daughter for a quick brunch. Quick and easy free parking. Crazy good brunch food... Review by - Yelp Sunny K: Love the vibe and service here. Friendly but not pushy. Great hamburgers and always have the games on tv. Hello from a fellow New Yorker! Review by - Yelp Lucas A: Great spot for having a beer and grabbing a bite. The food is spectacular and very reasonably priced for the quality you receive. Nice ambiance and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. I also respect that they have Guinness on tap along with Guinness glasses... Review by - Yelp Amy B: Sitting at the bar is like sitting down at owner Brandon's home. The service is awesome. Get the burger- perfectly cooked, juicy. It doesn't try to do anything that it's not. It's just an awesome burger cooked to perfection. Review by - Yelp Vas K: Great food and excellent service. Our group of 6 thoroughly enjoyed every dish. Highly recommend this new addition to Charleston.
