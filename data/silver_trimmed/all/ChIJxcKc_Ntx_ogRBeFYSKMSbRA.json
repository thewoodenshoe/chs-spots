Pleasant residents Anthony and Dana Collins were eager to start a new business venture. Dana had been a stay-at-home mom and had recently finished up a Biology degree at the College of Charleston, while Anthony worked in logistics. Their oldest daughter Erika was about to graduate from the College of Charleston and their sons Griffin and Ethan were starting their freshman year of college and high school respectively. Anthony, who had always been passionate about nutrition, found a listing for a locally-owned juice bar. He immediately knew that it would be the perfect way to invest back into the Mt. Pleasant community that they loved. With Erika and Dana helping lead the charge, Anthony’s family became the proud owners of The Main Squeeze ®. With a focus on improving health and fostering long-term relationships with customers, The Main Squeeze soon became a favorite around town. Griffin, Ethan, and many more enthusiastic employees soon joined the team and continue to help the business grow and promote healthy living. The Collins Family THE MAIN SQUEEZE DIFFERENCE Everything on our menu is made to order. Freshly pressed juice quickly unleashes vital nutrients to your body. Our Classic and Signature smoothies check all the marks when it comes to health benefits, taste, and caloric content.
