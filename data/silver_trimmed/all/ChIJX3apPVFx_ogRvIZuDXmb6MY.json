We are proud to be part of an endangered species, the family-owned and operated business. Please enjoy our hospitality and know that we are grateful for your patronage. Twenty-seven years ago, Patti and Bill fulfilled their Dad’s dream of owning a little Irish pub. The sister and brother team took a risk by bringing a little slice of New England to Sullivan’s Island. Boy, has that risk paid off! These twenty seven years have brought us more friends here in our adopted state of South Carolina than we could ever imagine. Our friends really get around, too. It always tickles us when someone reports seeing a Dunleavy’s t-shirt in Las Vegas, Ireland or at the Vatican (no joke!).\n\nPatti has retired and her son, Jamie, along with Bill now hold down the fort. We look forward to your visit soon!\n\nSlainté\nBill & Jamie\n\n(843) 883-9646\n\n2213 Middle St # A,\nSullivan's Island, SC 29482\nDUNLEAVY'S PUB Directions/Map Hours: \nMonday\n\n3PM - 1AM\n\nTuesday\n\n3PM - 1AM\n\nWednesday\n\n11:30AM - 1AM\n\nThursday\n\n11:30AM - 1AM\n\nFriday\n\n11:30AM - 2AM\n\nSaturday\n\n11:30AM - 2AM\n\nSunday\n\n11:30AM - 1AM\nPhone:",
