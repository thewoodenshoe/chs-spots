View Gallery Meet Hank's Chef TIM RICHARDSON, EXECUTIVE CHEF Like many chefs, South Carolina native Tim Richardson gravitated to the kitchen as a teenager. Richardson spent several years learning the restaurant business at locally owned steak houses in Columbia, S.C., before discovering his niche at Twigs, a charming restaurant located in Blowing Rock, North Carolina. Under the tutelage of Twigs Chef Ryan Brevda, Richardson honed his appreciation for preparing high quality ingredients and crafting a fine dining experience. To further refine his culinary skills, Richardson relocated in 2001 to Charleston, S.C., where he enrolled in Johnson & Wales University and began mentoring at Hank’s Seafood Restaurant under founding Chef Frank McMahon. Today, Richardson’s culinary talent, passion for fresh seafood, and dedication to all aspects of running a restaurant serve him well as Executive Chef of Hank’s Seafood Restaurant, a role he earned after many successful years as the restaurant’s Chef de Cuisine. Tim recently was a finalist for Charleston’s best chef as voted by readers of The Post & Courier, Charleston’s Choice Awards.

Learn More Gallery TAKE A LOOK INSIDE HANK’S SEAFOOD RESTAURANT Voted Best Seafood Restaurant in Charleston for 20 years running! View Gallery Meet Hank's Chef TIM RICHARDSON, EXECUTIVE CHEF Like many chefs, South Carolina native Tim Richardson gravitated to the kitchen as a teenager. Richardson spent several years learning the restaurant business at locally owned steak houses in Columbia, S.C., before discovering his niche at Twigs, a charming restaurant located in Blowing Rock, North Carolina. Under the tutelage of Twigs Chef Ryan Brevda, Richardson honed his appreciation for preparing high quality ingredients and crafting a fine dining experience. To further refine his culinary skills, Richardson relocated in 2001 to Charleston, S.C., where he enrolled in Johnson & Wales University and began mentoring at Hank’s Seafood Restaurant under founding Chef Frank McMahon. Today, Richardson’s culinary talent, passion for fresh seafood, and dedication to all aspects of running a restaurant serve him well as Executive Chef of Hank’s Seafood Restaurant, a role he earned after many successful years as the restaurant’s Chef de Cuisine. Tim recently was a finalist for Charleston’s best chef as voted by readers of The Post & Courier, Charleston’s Choice Awards. Hank's Classic Recipes FROM OUR KITCHEN TO YOURS Celebrating 25 years of delivering Southern hospitality and carefully crafted artisan dishes. Chef Tim has pulled Hank’s most memorable recipes from the archives for you to create at home.
