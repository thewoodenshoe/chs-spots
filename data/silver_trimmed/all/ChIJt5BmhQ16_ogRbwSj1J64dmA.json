Richardson spent several years learning the restaurant business at locally owned steak houses in Columbia, S.C., before discovering his niche at Twigs, a charming restaurant located in Blowing Rock, North Carolina. Under the tutelage of Twigs Chef Ryan Brevda, Richardson honed his appreciation for preparing high quality ingredients and crafting a fine dining experience.\n\nTo further refine his culinary skills, Richardson relocated in 2001 to Charleston, S.C., where he enrolled in Johnson & Wales University and began mentoring at Hank’s Seafood Restaurant under founding Chef Frank McMahon. Today, Richardson’s culinary talent, passion for fresh seafood, and dedication to all aspects of running a restaurant serve him well as Executive Chef of Hank’s Seafood Restaurant, a role he earned after many successful years as the restaurant’s Chef de Cuisine. Tim recently was a finalist for Charleston’s best chef as voted by readers of The Post & Courier, Charleston’s Choice Awards.\n\nHank's Classic Recipes\nFROM OUR KITCHEN TO YOURS \nCelebrating 25 years of delivering Southern hospitality and carefully crafted artisan dishes.

Richardson spent several years learning the restaurant business at locally owned steak houses in Columbia, S.C., before discovering his niche at Twigs, a charming restaurant located in Blowing Rock, North Carolina. Under the tutelage of Twigs Chef Ryan Brevda, Richardson honed his appreciation for preparing high quality ingredients and crafting a fine dining experience.\n\nTo further refine his culinary skills, Richardson relocated in 2001 to Charleston, S.C., where he enrolled in Johnson & Wales University and began mentoring at Hank’s Seafood Restaurant under founding Chef Frank McMahon. Today, Richardson’s culinary talent, passion for fresh seafood, and dedication to all aspects of running a restaurant serve him well as Executive Chef of Hank’s Seafood Restaurant, a role he earned after many successful years as the restaurant’s Chef de Cuisine. Tim recently was a finalist for Charleston’s best chef as voted by readers of The Post & Courier, Charleston’s Choice Awards.\n\nHank's Classic Recipes\nFROM OUR KITCHEN TO YOURS \nCelebrating 25 years of delivering Southern hospitality and carefully crafted artisan dishes.
