We continuously make great strides to be inventive and spunky in the kitchen while sourcing as much as we can locally. Our local, grass fed beef comes from cattle herds that are raised in South Carolina grass pasture as well as regional pastures. Our grain-finished beef is also raised on grass but spends the last few of months of life eating grains to add more fat to the meat.
