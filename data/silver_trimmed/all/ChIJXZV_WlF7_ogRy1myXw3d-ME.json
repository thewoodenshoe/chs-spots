They had super creative oyster shooters that were amazing. Can't wait to go back. Google reviews Haley H: five star review by Myself and some friends came here for the NYE party and it was such a fun experience! The service was top notch. We never had an empty drink and everyone checked on us religiously. Even the bathroom was well kept and I could tell everyone working was very happy to be there. Google reviews Chris W: five star review by First time here and loved it! Excellent brunch menu and great service to keep the mimosas flowing. My chicken and waffles was a hit. Nice and crunchy. Nice heat without being overwhelming. Hot, crispy waffles. Yum. We also got the breakfast burrito and the breakfast bowl. Everyone loved their dishes! Google reviews Ashley W: five star review by Completely in love with this place! Went here to wind down from the shots and the food is amazing!
