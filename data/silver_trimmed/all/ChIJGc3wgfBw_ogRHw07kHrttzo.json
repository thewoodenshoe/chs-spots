I love salsa with my omelet but the pico was nice and refreshing. Will was our server and he was great. See you next time Will!” Monica FAT BOY “Great Experiences” Jermainevans OLD SCHOOL BREAKFAST “just to have some more!” Carol EGG WHITE OMELET “It was our final morning in your incredible city. Despite the fact that there was another restaurant we could have tried to get the full low country experience, we decided a second trip to your store was for us! It was a Monday morning so most of your customers were local workers grabbing something for the road. The staff was so attentive and showed us some real southern hospitality. This time I felt the need to go with a healthier option and chose the Egg White Omelet. I asked to switch out the Feta for your white cheddar and I decided to add your potatoes (I know – so much for healthy – LOL). It was delicious and your manager on duty allowed me to sample your pimento cheese – It was a delight to the tongue. I actually got some to take home in our cooler. Thanks for making our trip so wonderful” Carol Scroll to Top",
