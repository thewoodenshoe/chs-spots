      "text": "Core Beer Park Circle Juicy Pale Ale, 5.5% ABV This American Pale Ale is our year-round hop-forward pale offering. Expect strong tropical aromas, a soft body, with subtle juiciness and haze. Looking East West Coast IPA, 6.2% ABV This hop-forward IPA is Commonhouse’s West Coast IPA, bursting with citrusy and resinous flavors. Centennial, Chinook and Simcoe hops lend flavors that will remind you of citrus peel, piney mango, and grapefruit. Red Fox Irish Style Red Ale, 5% ABV A classic Irish Red, the hallmark toasty cocoa first impression puts you squarely in one place—Ireland—sharing a pint elbow to elbow at the neighborhood pub. Layers of subtle fruit—apricot, plum, even tomato—underpin the classic malty tones. The Air is Salty Gose Style Sour Ale, 5.2% ABV The Air Is Salty is our interpretation of a traditional Gose-style beer. This zingy sour beer is accented with notes of coriander, as well as the addition of locally-sourced Bull’s Bay Sea Salt. A refreshingly tart beer, great for the beach and boat. White Point American Style Lager, 5.3% ABV White Point Lager is a crisp and refreshing American-style craft beer brewed for hot Charleston summers, yet enjoyed all year round. Double Parked Double IP, 8% ABV We share a lot in common Including being old enough to drink. ID please? Are you over 21 years of age? Yes No",

Beer is a central component of communities throughout the history of civilization. And while beer is what we make, it is not our why. We are a community impact organization hoping to serve in the development of people and relationships that celebrate all we share in common which in turn positively impacts our community and world.

While we do have options for semi-private or full site rental, events at Commonhouse need to fit within our day-to-day operations. Our beautiful semi-private space comfortably fits groups ranging in size from 10 to 125+ with a combination of tables, Adirondack chairs, and standing room. This option is great for birthdays, rehearsal dinners, networking mixers, etc. Catering is available through Florie’s at Commonhouse for larger groups, and we have many beverage order options including drink tickets, individual tabs, and a private bar setup. In addition to our craft beer, we offer a variety of wines, cider, ready-to-drink canned cocktails, frozen cocktails, as well as numerous non-alcoholic options including soda, tea, and kombucha. Semi-private: Prices vary depending on the time, day, and month.
