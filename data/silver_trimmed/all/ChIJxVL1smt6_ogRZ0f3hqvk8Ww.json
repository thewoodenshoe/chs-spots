Crowd skews college age, but we still enjoyed the DJ, drinks and patio. Review by - Yelp Debbie D: We stopped at this quaint restaurant on our way out of town. We loved the fish and chips and the Popcorn shrimp. This Gen-xer loved the 90's playlist. We will definitely return on our next trip to Charleston. Review by - Yelp Terrence J: Great place to hang out at absolutely enjoyed the outside patio with my guest. Good food laid back atmosphere Review by - Yelp Brendan S: ...We came in for one drink and I'm writing this review half drunk BC I didn't want to leave these people + singer. Really impressed.
