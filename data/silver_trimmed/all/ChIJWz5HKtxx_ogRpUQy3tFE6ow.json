They told us it would be a 25 minute wait for a table but it was really less than 10. The spicy pomegranate margarita was fantastic as well as the gyoza. All three of the rolls we got were also delicious and were very large. Decent happy hour specials, even on Friday.\n\nReview by - google\n\nCaroline S:\nfive star review by \nReally good sushi and great lunch specials! I had the shrimp and vegetables tempura bento box and it was very plentiful! I couldn't even eat it all! My husband had the 'resolution roll' and really loved it by warns its very spicy! So, if you like heat, go for that one! They've always got great specials going. There is a nice outside area to sit and the inside is very cozy with a small bar area. It's got a great neighborhood feel to it!\n\nReview by - google\n\nAbigail W:\nfive star review by \nI ordered take out and was really happy with my food. Got a shrimp tempura roll and avocado and cucumber roll. The shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly, super crispy and flavorful. The avocado and cucumber roll was incredibly fresh. They also provided a generous side of ginger and wasabi. Received way more pieces per roll than I was expecting which made it a fair price in my opinion. Looking forward to ordering again soon!\n\nReview by - google\n\nArturo G:\nfive star review by \nI'm glad my friends brought me to Fuji, first time being here and all I can say is that everything was amazing the service and the food. We had many different dishes and all were great! Definitely will be coming regularly and I recommend this place.\n\nReservations\n\nJoin us today\n\nClick the button below to make a reservation.\nBook your Fuji Sushi Bar and Grill - Belle Hall reservation on Resy \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n644 Long Point Rd.\n\nMt.
