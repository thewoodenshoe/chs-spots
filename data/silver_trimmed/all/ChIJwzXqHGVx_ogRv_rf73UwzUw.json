We might not take ourselves too seriously, but we sure take our food seriously. Learn More Allegen and Gluten-Free Information: For our customers with food allergies and/or sensitivities, please inform your server prior to ordering. Our gluten-free items are often prepared with shared equipment (including a shared toaster) and cross contact is very likely. If you have an allergy or sensitivity, please ask that your order be prepared using our allergen handling procedures. We cannot guarantee that cross contact with foods containing allergens will not occur but will make a reasonable effort to avoid it. This information details which of the most common allergens are present in each menu item. According to the FDA, highly refined soybean oil is not considered one of the major food allergens and therefore is not listed here. All ingredient statements were found on manufacturer-generated spec sheets. It is possible that formulations may change, or an ingredient or vendor substitution might be made which may not be immediately reflected in this chart. Note we try to exercise caution and follow certain allergen procedures to prevent cross contact, but our ingredients containing milk, egg, fish, peanut, sesame, tree nut, shellfish, soy, wheat, and other allergens are made in the same kitchen and there is still a risk of cross-contact with shared surfaces and equipment. Please consult your healthcare provider to determine the types of precautions you should take before enjoying any of our menu items. Also, please allow extra time to prepare your special order. Nutrition Information: 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary. Additional nutrition information available upon request. The nutritional information seen here was prepared by a third party and is based on standard serving sizes and product formulations prepared with approved ingredients. The nutritional data is based on representative values from the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference and information from product manufacturers. All of our nutritional values are rounded according to NLEA/FDA rounding regulations, so the sum of the ingredients may not always equal the total. Variation may occur due to the handcrafted nature of our menu items or due to seasonal influences and/or sources of supply of our ingredients. Additionally, formulations may change on occasion, or the substitution of ingredients or suppliers may be necessary which will alter the nutritional values. This information was provided by a third-party consultant, MenuTrinfo, to help give our guests the tools to make an informed decision.

We might not take ourselves too seriously, but we sure take our food seriously. Learn More Allegen and Gluten-Free Information: For our customers with food allergies and/or sensitivities, please inform your server prior to ordering. Our gluten-free items are often prepared with shared equipment (including a shared toaster) and cross contact is very likely. If you have an allergy or sensitivity, please ask that your order be prepared using our allergen handling procedures. We cannot guarantee that cross contact with foods containing allergens will not occur but will make a reasonable effort to avoid it. This information details which of the most common allergens are present in each menu item. According to the FDA, highly refined soybean oil is not considered one of the major food allergens and therefore is not listed here. All ingredient statements were found on manufacturer-generated spec sheets. It is possible that formulations may change, or an ingredient or vendor substitution might be made which may not be immediately reflected in this chart. Note we try to exercise caution and follow certain allergen procedures to prevent cross contact, but our ingredients containing milk, egg, fish, peanut, sesame, tree nut, shellfish, soy, wheat, and other allergens are made in the same kitchen and there is still a risk of cross-contact with shared surfaces and equipment. Please consult your healthcare provider to determine the types of precautions you should take before enjoying any of our menu items. Also, please allow extra time to prepare your special order. Nutrition Information: 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary. Additional nutrition information available upon request. The nutritional information seen here was prepared by a third party and is based on standard serving sizes and product formulations prepared with approved ingredients. The nutritional data is based on representative values from the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference and information from product manufacturers. All of our nutritional values are rounded according to NLEA/FDA rounding regulations, so the sum of the ingredients may not always equal the total. Variation may occur due to the handcrafted nature of our menu items or due to seasonal influences and/or sources of supply of our ingredients. Additionally, formulations may change on occasion, or the substitution of ingredients or suppliers may be necessary which will alter the nutritional values. This information was provided by a third-party consultant, MenuTrinfo, to help give our guests the tools to make an informed decision.

We might not take ourselves too seriously, but we sure take our food seriously. Learn More Allegen and Gluten-Free Information: For our customers with food allergies and/or sensitivities, please inform your server prior to ordering. Our gluten-free items are often prepared with shared equipment (including a shared toaster) and cross contact is very likely. If you have an allergy or sensitivity, please ask that your order be prepared using our allergen handling procedures. We cannot guarantee that cross contact with foods containing allergens will not occur but will make a reasonable effort to avoid it. This information details which of the most common allergens are present in each menu item. According to the FDA, highly refined soybean oil is not considered one of the major food allergens and therefore is not listed here. All ingredient statements were found on manufacturer-generated spec sheets. It is possible that formulations may change, or an ingredient or vendor substitution might be made which may not be immediately reflected in this chart. Note we try to exercise caution and follow certain allergen procedures to prevent cross contact, but our ingredients containing milk, egg, fish, peanut, sesame, tree nut, shellfish, soy, wheat, and other allergens are made in the same kitchen and there is still a risk of cross-contact with shared surfaces and equipment. Please consult your healthcare provider to determine the types of precautions you should take before enjoying any of our menu items. Also, please allow extra time to prepare your special order. Nutrition Information: 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary. Additional nutrition information available upon request. The nutritional information seen here was prepared by a third party and is based on standard serving sizes and product formulations prepared with approved ingredients. The nutritional data is based on representative values from the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference and information from product manufacturers. All of our nutritional values are rounded according to NLEA/FDA rounding regulations, so the sum of the ingredients may not always equal the total. Variation may occur due to the handcrafted nature of our menu items or due to seasonal influences and/or sources of supply of our ingredients. Additionally, formulations may change on occasion, or the substitution of ingredients or suppliers may be necessary which will alter the nutritional values. This information was provided by a third-party consultant, MenuTrinfo, to help give our guests the tools to make an informed decision.
