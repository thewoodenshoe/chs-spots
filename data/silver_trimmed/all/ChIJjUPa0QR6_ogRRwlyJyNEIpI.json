The meticulous design and oversight by eefava architects ensured that the original character and details of the historic property were maintained while incorporating completely new mechanical, electrical, and other modern advances to the infrastructure. Tammy Connor’s interior design reflects the elegant charms of its historic Charleston backdrop by incorporating antiques with modern craftsmanship to create comfortable, inviting, and one-of-a-kind interiors.
