AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING CHINA, GLASSWARE OR FLATWARE?\n\nNo. Just make sure all large debris has been removed from plates and glassware is empty then re-rack or re-crate the used items in the same ones they arrived in.\n\n2. HOW SHOULD I RETURN TABLE CLOTHS?\n\nWe will provide you with a pre-labeled mesh bag to collect and table cloths.\nused unused \n3. WILL SNYDER SET UP RENTAL ITEMS FOR ME?\n\nWe are happy to place tables and chairs for a small set up fee, let us know and we can add that to your quote! We ask that you provide a diagram of your venue including table and table locations. Please note we do not set linens or place settings.\n\n4. WHAT SIZE DANCE FLOOR WILL I NEED?\n\nThe size of your dance floor may vary based on the venue, group and event type, but as a general rule we suggest approximately two (2) sq ft per guest. For dance floor pricing information, see our.\nDance Floor Pricing Guide \n5. HOW MANY GLASSES DO I NEED?\n\nWe recommend one glass per person per hour.\n\n6. DO I NEED TABLE CLOTHS TO COVER TABLES I RENT FROM SNYDER?\n\nYes, our folding table look best under linens. If you're looking for something different, see products for our selection of stand-alone tables.\nSnyder Lounge \n7. WHAT HAPPENS WE ACCIDENTALLY BREAK A GLASS OR STAIN A TABLE CLOTH?\n\nDon't worry about it! Our damage waiver covers all incidental damage so you're off the hook. This waiver does not cover gross negligence, lost or stolen items. The replacement cost of all missing items will be charged to contracted client if missing items are not returned within 7 days of event date.\n\nTents\n\n1. CAN I RESERVE A TENT IN CASE IT RAINS?\n\nYes, we allow tent holds for 75% of the tent rental price (+tax). You then make the rain call by noon 2 days prior to your installation (example Thursday by noon for a Saturday install), at which time you are only charged 75% of the tent price ( plus tax and permit fee if applicable). If you cancel your reservation within 90 days your deposit is non refundable. If you choose to wait, and cancel your tent within 48 hours, you are charged the full tent rental price.\n\n2. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POLE TENT AND A FRAME TENT?\n\nA pole tent is a traditional tent style that requires its interior poles to be anchored to the ground. Most pole tents have square ends but we offer Sailcloth tents that feature round ends. Sailcloth tents, a form of pole tent, are popular with wedding and special event planners for their sculpted peaks and eaves and nautical flag accents. Sailcloth tents are also sought out for the way light glows against their canvas at night.\n\nA frame tent is a freestanding tent with no interior poles, which allows for unobstructed space. Frame tents can be anchored by stakes or weights. We have two types of frame tents: Hip-end and Gable-end. Gable-end tents are designed to allow for maximum use of interior space. We also offer Structure frame tents that are engineered span larger areas and withstand harsh environmental conditions.\n\n3. DO I NEED A TENT PERMIT?\n\nYou need a tent permit within certain city limits. We will handle that for you!\n\n4. WHAT SIZE TENT DO I NEED?\n\nSee our for sizing help.\nTent Planning Guide \n5. CAN I PLACE A TENT ON ASPHALT?\n\nYes, but pole tents can only go on asphalt if staking is permitted in the area. Frame tents can be staked or weighed down with ballasts.\n\n6. CAN I PLACE A TENT ON CONCRETE?\n\nFrame tents can be used on concrete and weighed down with ballasts. Staking is not allowed on concrete so pole and sail tents cannot be used.\n\n7. CAN I PLACE A TENT ON AN UNEVEN SURFACE?\n\nYou can place a frame tent on an uneven surface or you can use our flooring system to level the surface.\n\n8. CAN I USE CEMENT BLOCKS TO HOLD A FRAME TENT DOWN?\n\nYes, we can secure a tent with ballasts for an extra rental expense.\n\n9. DOES THE PRICE OF THE TENT INCLUDE INSTALLATION?\n\nYes, the tent price includes the cost of standard installation within regular business hours. Instances where we are required to install or strike a tent before/after hours may incur an additional labor fee.\n\n10. DO SNYDER TENT WALLS ROLL UP?\n\nWe do offer walls for our tents, but they do not roll up. They must be installed prior to your event.\n\nLounge\n\n1. WHERE CAN I COME TO SHOP FOR SNYDER LOUNGE FURNITURE?\n\nWe keep sample pieces in our main office at 3875 Meeting St. Our website also features our full selection of Lounge rentals. We can accommodate a viewing of a specific item by appointment.\n\n2. HOW MANY HEATERS WILL I NEED?\n\nOur mushroom patio heaters will radiate heat throughout a 400 square foot space. For full coverage, heaters should be placed about 20 feet apart. A heat cannon will heat approximately 1600 square feet inside a 40x40 tent.\n\nHours of Operation\n\n1. DO I NEED AN APPOINTMENT TO VISIT YOUR SHOWROOM?\n\nAn appointment is required to visit our showroom. By making an appointment, we can be better prepared to assist you with your rental needs.\n\n2. WHAT ARE YOUR DELIVERY HOURS?\n\nWe offer standard delivery between 9am - 5pm scheduled in 4 hour windows 7 days a week (please call the office regarding holidays).

MAY I PICK UP MY RENTAL ITEMS AT YOUR LOCATION TO AVOID DELIVERY FEES?\n\nYes, we provide express pick up for all prepaid rentals.\n\n2. WHY ARE SNYDER RENTAL AND SNYDER LOUNGE SEPARATE INVOICES?\n\nRental and Lounge are actually separate companies. Lounge is a different product line with a special crew for handling. Your Rental and Lounge items will come from different warehouses at different delivery times as well.\n\n3. DOES SNYDER CHARGE A DELIVERY FEE? IF SO, WHAT IS THE DELIVERY FEE?\n\nPlease email info@snyderevents.com for current delivery pricing.\n\n4. DOES SNYDER OFFER NIGHT-TIME PICK UP?\n\nYes, in season we run a full pick-up crew Thursday through Sunday. However, we can make arrangements to accommodate Monday through Wednesday night pick-ups on a case-by-case basis.\n\n5. WHAT AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR WHEN MY DELIVERY RENTALS ARE DROPPED OFF?\n\nNothing. We can drop everything off and set up your rentals at the locations as indicated. You are not required to meet us on site, but it is suggested so you can check in the items and confirm exact placement of your items!\n\nPayment processing, deposits\n\n1. DO YOU REQUIRE A DEPOSIT?\n\nYes, we require a 50% deposit.\n\n2. WHAT IS YOUR CANCELLATION POLICY?\n\nA 50% deposit is required to secure all items on order. This deposit is non-refundable within 90 days of your event date.

Orders affected and/or postponed will be moved to a rescheduled\ndate (items subject to availability). All monies paid prior to the cancellation will roll over to the new order on the rescheduled date. If the client chooses to cancel the event and not reschedule, the client will be liable for 50%\nof the order total. All monies previously paid above and beyond 50% will be refunded. Once an event is rescheduled, the deposit is nonrefundable.\n\n3. WHAT IS THE DAMAGE WAVER?\n\nAn 8% non-refundable damage waiver is added to each order to cover the cost of broken and damaged items. It is inevitable that glasses will be broken or taken by guests, China will be chipped, linens will be stained, etc. Our waiver allows us to cover those expenses without having to charge you more after the event. The damage waiver does not cover lost or stolen items or maliciously damaged items.\n\n4.

BUT, DEEP DOWN INSIDE he's still that wild child who ran away from home with only $10 and a lighter in 6th grade. He's the rowdy teen who brought an unconcealed flask to prom. He's that guy who built the bar with wood from a tree he chopped down last week. TODAY, Spike by Snyder operates the largest, most professional and experienced bar service in Charleston.\nGet a quote \nBar Services\n\nSpike preset and custom bar packages include the cost of your bartender, the alcoholic beverages and mixers in your selected package, ice, garnishes, plasticware, bar linens and Snyder's 24/7 support. Bar service rentals are scheduled in three-hour allotments but we can customize our services to fit with your timeline. Your Spike experience is guaranteed to include attentive service, our insurance coverage, continuous client support and plenty of beverages.\nX \nThank you for subscribing!",
