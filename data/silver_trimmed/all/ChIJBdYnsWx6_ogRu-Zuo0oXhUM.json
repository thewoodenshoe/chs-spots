We walked in and I was mind blown. The club is so Sophisticated and classy looking. We were asked if we wanted a bottle of Champagne free of charge I’m assuming due to my getting married. We were sat in VIP and brought the bottle along with a whole little light show. It was the best experience. Everyone was so nice including the bouncers and all the girls that work there.
