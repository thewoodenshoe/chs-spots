Imagine crispy crust and a warm, doughy middle layered with toppings we prepare in-house. The mozzarella is freshly-grated, the toppings are sliced just for you, and our hand-tossed dough is made in-house. Baked to the ideal crisp inside our brick deck oven, this is the quintessential pizza experience. Choose a specialty pie like the popular BBQ chicken or build your own 10, 14, or 18-inch—fold a slice and enjoy. Chicago STYLE Two inches thick and five pounds heavy, our Chicago Style pizza is a true deep dish. As the only pizzeria in Charleston that makes Chicago style, we pride ourselves on making it perfectly with our in-house dough, freshly-sliced toppings and special Chicago-style pans. We bake fresh mozzarella and toppings between two layers of light and fluffy dough, finishing it with a buttered crust, a layer of chunky tomato sauce and a sprinkle of parmesan on top. Go classic or try our Cheese Steak creation and cut in—this is not a pizza to be taken lightly. (If you’re up for it, check out our Chicago Challenge: one person, one topping, one hour.) Our Story Famulari’s Pizzeria was born from strong friendship, brotherhood, and a passion for pizza. In 2003, brothers Jason and Justin Famulari teamed up with longtime friends Josh and Brandon. With their 20+ years of pizza-making experience, they set out to create the best possible pizza. After five years of careful planning, the first Famulari’s Pizza launched in Summerville, South Carolina in 2008. We've been voted nearly every year since (Winner 2009-2015 & 2017-2024). BEST PIZZA In 2024, Famulari’s celebrated opening its 6th location when they opened their doors in Cane Bay. Now you can enjoy the famous pizzas all over the Charleston metro. As City Paper put it: “If you have to have pizza, and if you care what it tastes like, you should be at Famulari's.” bottom of page",
