There's a reason this place is so popular. Lo and Pat are fantastic bartenders. Super friendly and attentive. Lo's mojito is the best I've had outside of Havana. Muddled mint makes all the difference. review by - Yelp Claudia C.: Absolutely loved this place. The staff was awesome and very attentive when I sat down. Loved all the food we got, plan on going back for the C.a.b. Steak Sandwich because they know how to make a good sandwich. We came in on St. Patty's day and with how busy it was they ran the place perfectly. Bathrooms were clean and gender friendly and the patio in the back is a nice addition if you want to be outside and enjoy a drink. If you are in town you need to check this place out! review by - Yelp Dunn F.: This place is amazing. Kitchen closes at 10, so keep that in mind. It's an eclectic clientele and this means never a boring moment. The food is so good. I had my first 'Hot' chicken sandwich with truffle fries. Wow! My buddy opted for Brussel sprouts and they were so crisp and tasty. review by - Yelp Daniela Z.: I love the outdoor courtyard! The Nashville chicken sandwich and caprese panini are the best. For some reason this last time we went the panini kept getting messed up, which wasn't the server's fault, but when it's supposed to be vegetarian and the kitchen decides to add chicken to it, it's kind of weird! The food was still good, they have a good assortment of beers on tap, and of course the v i b e is on point, especially being in the heart of downtown. Service was good, too, despite it being busy! review by - Yelp Hunter L.: AMAZING food! Fantastic drinks! Went here for Sunday brunch and loved it. This place is really cool inside, and the back patio is great. Very affordable not only for Charleston but for the amount of food you get.
