Over its decades-long history, this beloved restaurant has become a staple of the Charleston community.\n\nLocation\n1515 Palm Blvd.Isle of Palms, SC (843) 886-8809 \nHours of Operation\n\nLunch\n\nMonday — Saturday11:00am — 2:00pm\n\nBrunch\n\nSunday11:00am — 2:00pm\n\nDinner\n\nMonday — Sunday5:00pm — until\n\nIOP Raw\n\nMonday — Sunday4:30pm — until\n\nrESERVATIONS\n\nReservations are prioritized due to high demand, particularly on weekends.Fill out the form to secure your spot.\n\nMenus\n\nIn 2012, the café underwent a revitalization with new ownership, breathing new life into the restaurant and menu.

Though the menu has evolved through all the transitions, classic dishes remain, with a continued emphasis on fresh, local seafood. New items and regularly changing specials keep the offerings vibrant.\n\nThis modern version of an island favorite has thrived, supporting local producers while serving up a diverse menu of seafood, pasta, American cuisine, and desserts. Sharing a kitchen allows guests to enjoy both menus in either dining room.\n\nLong Island Cafe Menu\nLunch Dinner Brunch Drinks Kid's Menu Steamers \nFAQs\n\nWhat are you known for?\n\nWe are known for our iconic fried seafood platters, fresh oysters, and our wildly popular Seafood Steamer Buckets.
