AboutOld School Snowballs Growing up, shaved ice snowballs were a treat. We’d make stops at the snowball stand after baseball games, after the pool, or just as an excuse to have a cool treat during the summer. The journey began with a Summer job when I was 14 years old. Now we have one simple idea: to create the perfect snowball. We experimented with different snow types, flavors, and toppings until we found the perfect combination that we are proud to serve today. Our snowballs are made from fresh, high-quality BLOCK ICE, ARE HAND SHAPED; NEVER PACKED. We understand that snowballs are not just a treat, That's why we are passionate about providing our customers with the best snowball experience possible. Whether you are enjoying our snowballs with your family or friends, we promise that each bite will be a delightful and refreshing experience.",
