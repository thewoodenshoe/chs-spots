So glad we did! Had already fallen in love with the homemade salsas, and were not disappointed in dinner. It was the best molcajete I've had! The staff are friendly, service was good. We sat at the bar. Will definitely be back regularly for their delicious, well made food. Brian Birkenstock The restaurant was beautifully decorated and the service was great. They were really good about refilling our drinks and as soon as the food came out it looked so delicious. It was all really good and tasty. Definitely recommend. Kris M Great food and atmosphere! We’re visiting Charleston and wanted something besides seafood. Found this place and tried it out. This place is so cute, had great food, and the service was excellent! I highly recommend! I.E. Xam The steak fajitas were very good. A dinner companion enjoyed the chimichangas. Expansive drink list including about 12 different margaritas. Also has draft beer. Lots of traditional mexican food items including tacos burritos enchiladas etc. Excellent service. Philip Antman Great food, amazing service, great prices! Best tomatillo salsa in Charleston. I recommend the street tacos, carnitas, or the shrimp al diablo. I'm a Mexican food connoisseur and I love this place. Nikki Rucker The food is consistent, and our servers are always attentive and fun! They feel like family and I enjoy their company. The interior is fun and comfortable!",
