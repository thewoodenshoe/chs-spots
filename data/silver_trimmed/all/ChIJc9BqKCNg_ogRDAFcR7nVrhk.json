Reserve Reviews review by - Yelp David Q: Found this hidden spot along the water. Great view, small place and amazing staff. The menu is simple and to the point. Burger was spot on and our son inhaled the truffle fries. We will be coming back when weather is warmer to let the kids run outside. review by - Yelp Sydney T: Went to dinner here last night with my book club to celebrate a birthday and they were so accommodating of our larger party (8!). The drinks were good, and well-priced in my opinion. We all split a few different appetizers and some truffle fries... review by - Yelp Kevin E: What a great find on the old Navy base in North Charleston! We visited for the first time recently and plan to be regulars. Momo is situated in an old Navy building by the Riverfront Park with terrific views of the Cooper River. There is a lot of patio seating with heaters and a fire pit, too... review by - Yelp Kimberly B: It's not often that I go to a restaurant twice while visiting a place because I usually want to visit many places, and this especially true for the Charleston area. But MOMO's kitchen blew me away! The CAROLINA GOLD RICE BOWL was extremely good. (I had it both times)... review by - Yelp Brian B: This place was quite a surprise in goose Creek. I went with my girlfriend and her brother. The decor is simple and sheik, and the food was not only beautiful, but very tasty. I highly recommend trying this place out, especially if you live in Goose Creek.
