Explore \"Our stay in Charleston was wonderful\" I loved the quaintness of the hotel. It has that Charleston charm. We look forward to returning and will be booking at The Kings Courtyard Inn. Kimberly 4/11/25 \"Your searching stops here!\" This hotel has all the charm of the past with all of the convenience of the present. I took my teenage daughters and we walked everywhere. Super safe area. 5-7 minute walk to everywhere you want to go. Around the corner from the open Market where you will want to go for sure. Carriage rides are there. The BEST seafood is by there as well. You are literally ON King Street where all the beautiful shops are. The parking lot is behind the hotel, but it connected to it so you park and walk into the lobby. Beautiful rooms, free delicious warm breakfast served to you at your table (or delivered to your room), easy parking, the sweetest staff. This has everything. We will be back and will not stay anywhere else. Kayla B | 4/9/25 \"Great three night stay\" The location is absolutely perfect. Staff is friendly and room was nice and clean. This is an older building but room felt new and updated. Breakfast delivered to your room in the morning is a game changer. Melissa S. | 3/30/25 \"Did I just stumble up on the best hotel in town?\" This little hidden gem of an historic hotel is tucked away in THE PERFECT location. Out the front door is King Street, with all the big name shops. Out the back door, across the small lot where your car is parked, the Charleston market is only a short two minutes away. You are truly in the middle of everything, with no need to move your car unless you want to go to the beach or leave the historic district. The hotel itself is stunning. Hospitality is as Southern as it gets, with breakfast in the morning, wine and cheese reception in the evening, and a sherry night cap before bed, all complimentary. The room was unbelievably spacious and comfortable. The option to light the gas fire place was a nice touch. Every employee we spoke to was so kind and helpful. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.
