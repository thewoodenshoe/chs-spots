      "text": "food with a story tastes better From chef, cookbook author and PBS star, Vivian Howard, LENOIR reminds people that the South is a nuanced place with a storied history and disparate terrain that shapes us as well as our food traditions. Here we cook to perpetuate, honor and evolve the cuisine of the rural, agricultural South, and we back it up with hospitality that buys into the idea that food with a story tastes better. Named for Vivian’s home county in eastern North Carolina, LENOIR exalts the pillars of Southern hospitality and leaves people feeling like they are guests in our home rather than patrons in our restaurant. more about Vivian address + phone 68 wentworth streetcharleston, sc 29401 843.534.9031 reservations Book your Lenoir CHS reservation on Resy Book via OpenTable hours breakfast 7:30-10:30 // bar 3-11 // dinner 5-10 monday-thursday breakfast 7:30-10:30 // bar 3-12 // dining 5-10 friday brunch 10-2:30bar 3-12 // dinner 5-10 saturday // brunch 10-2:30bar 3-11 // dinner 5-10 sunday // ___________ parking complimentary validated self-parking is available in the deck directly across from Lenoir at 69 Wentworth Street.
