They had a very cool atmosphere. I sat at the bar and ordered a pomegranate margarita. The bartender was very friendly and the drinks were very good... review by - Yelp Brittany V: Absolutely amazing service, and the food was incredible as well! Being from California... So difficult to find authentic Mexican food, and I feel like I've finally found it! Will definitely be back again VERY soon. review by - Yelp Kelly G: Came here for a quick cocktail . Cool vibe and beautiful marble top bar . The bartender was friendly and fast . Offered us complimentary chips and salsa with our drinks . The space was clean and modern... review by - Yelp Alexia R: The food is absolutely amazing. I appreciate the food and decor not being cheesy Tex-Mex. The tacos were good and super fresh tortilla and toppings. I always come back for anything with rice and beans because they're so good here... review by - Yelp Mike D: Very clean restaurant with a cool vibe. My burrito was very good, as was my wife's chicken quesadilla. A bit tight and loud in there and every table was full even on a Wednesday night but we only had a short wait. Will definitely be back.
