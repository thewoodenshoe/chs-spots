Make people feel at home, keep the damn beer cold, and make simple food favorites exceptionally well. That's why we are here.\nOur menu Parties \nBook your next party with us!\n\nNeed the space for your event?

We are 2 Senior ladies n stopped in. Great service. Place clean. We ordered hamburgs on rye. W/carmelized onions. Melt in my mouth delicious. Hard to find a awesome burger.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nClaudia H:\n\nLDOB has amazing food and incredibly reasonable prices, especially because they have daily specials! Thursday's half price burger it's not only delicious but a deal you can't beat! Cold, inexpensive beer, and a laid back atmosphere make it a favorite of the locals!!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nWilliam B:\n\nGot to-go here the other day. I've had many friends that go there a ton but this was our first. Inside is small but there's a larger covered outdoor patio with tv's that seem like a good hangout spot. We had the meatballs, quesadilla and philly. All were on point. The cornbread dessert stole the show however...\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nVickie P:\n\nNot the first time on James island, but definitely the first time at LDOB. Our server Sean is nice and personable. Food is great, not one complaint from the group, including my little one. The bar itself appears to be a local hang out...\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nMark W:\n\nIt's a five because it's what I wanted. Had the chicken pesto pizzA and it was as good as I get in NY and NJ. The menu looked great. What a nice place. Might be back tonight for music. Wish lived closer. Maybe I will someday. Bravo on the service.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nGREAT PIZZA\nOur Menu \nOutside dining\nBook a party \nBURGERS &CHEESESTEAKS\nOur Menu Dot slide navigation number 1 Dot slide navigation number 2 Dot slide navigation number 3 slideshow start stop playing \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\n967 Folly Rd\n\nJames Island, SC\n\n29412\n\nHours\n\nMon, Tue, Wed\n\n11:00 AM - 12:00 AM\n\nThur, Fri\n\n11:00 AM - 1:00 AM\n\nSat\n\n10:00 AM - 12:00 AM\n\nSun\n\n12:00 AM - 2:00 AM\n\nFind us on...\nTwitter page Instagram page Yelp page \nContact us\n(843)-795-7569 dporter@whatsthelowdown.com \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper. × \nNewsletter",
