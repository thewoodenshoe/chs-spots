View Menu Reservation 7 Our Story Nick’s German Kitchen German food with a modern twist… that is Nick’s German Kitchen! Restaurateurs Nick & Kelly have been serving their German favorites since 2004 when they opened up their boutique restaurant “Mezzo” in Darmstadt Germany, a combination of German & Italian cuisine served in an intimate upscale location. Fast forward 15 years to 2019… Nick & Kelly opened up a new “Mezzo” in Charleston, South Carolina. Serving an upbeat blend of European specialties with a heavy emphasis on German and Italian, Mezzo found many followers in the greater Charleston area. By far the favorite items on Chef Nick’s diverse menu: the Schnitzel! So many came just for Schnitzel and Spaetzle alone that after two years of Mezzo, Nick & Kelly decided to answer the overwhelming demand for more of Nick’s German specialties and rebranded to Nick’s German Kitchen in 2021. Featuring scratch-made German specialties like Schnitzel, Spaetzle and more, Nick’s German Kitchen offers an authentic German kitchen infused with a modern vibe. Flavorful, fresh and appealing, Nick’s German will make you rethink everything you think you know about German food!
