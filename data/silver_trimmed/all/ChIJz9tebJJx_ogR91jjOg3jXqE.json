The order was executed correctly, it was easy to get a bartenders' attention when I arrived, and the food was ready when they said it would be. Easy parking. The build-your-own salad is a great idea. My husband enjoyed his entree. We will get food from them again soon!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nMakenzie L:\n\nKing Street Grill is always our go to for Sunday football! We're falcons fans and often don't get the game at home, so King Street is one of the only places we've found with enough TVs to satisfy everyone's football needs. We normally sit at the bar and the service is always top notch. The bartenders immediately greet you and continuously check on you to make sure you have everything you need...\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nRealty Pros K:\n\nWow! This bar and grill has AMAZING food and service! We came in last night for some wings and burgers. Talk about elevating bar and pub food- wowza! The wings were some of the best that we have ever had anywhere- perfectly crispy, tender and steaming hot...This little neighborhood joint gets our highest possible recommendation.\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nMadison K:\n\nMe and my family enjoyed dinner at the Grille. The place was kept very clean and all workers were wearing masks and gloves when handling our food/dishes and drinks. The food itself was amazing! They had a range of options and even had great options for kids. I had the chicken Cesar side salad and wrap! Amazing!\n\nreview by - Yelp\n\nJennifer F:\n\nThe food was delicious. We sat outside, they had a covered area set up with a fan it was quite toasty but it didn't take away from the experience. They did have inside seats but we opted to eat outside. The waitress was professional and kind. She was wearing a mask. She checked on us quite a bit even though we sat outside.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nNewsletter\n\nLocation\n\nOpen daily in Mount Pleasant\n\nKing Street Grille\n1136 Hungryneck Blvd \n,\nMt.
