James Island is all about community vibes in a neighborhood setting. It’s a perfect spot for families, friends, locals and visitors to kick back and enjoy our signature West Tennessee-Style Whole Hog BBQ. Just as we do at all our Martin’s, we come in at 5 AM every morning to smoke our barbecue for 20+ hours over local hickory wood. Our menu features all the Martin’s Bar-B-Que classics, from our West Tennessee-Style Whole Hog BBQ, to Spare Ribs, Burgers, Smoked Wings and some darn good BBQ Nachos. We’ve also got some seriously stellar scratch-made Southern Sides and fresh-baked Pies, along with a full bar serving up Signature Cocktails, tons of regional beers, and an all-natural wine list.

It takes up to 24 hours to smoke our barbecue, and that means we often sell-through some items on some days. While we can't rush the process, we can suggest you come early (and often!) to make sure you get the full Martin's experience.
