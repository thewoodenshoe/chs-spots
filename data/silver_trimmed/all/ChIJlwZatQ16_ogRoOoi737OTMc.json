This means that each beef cut has been verified 100% to be of USDA Prime quality, and aged to our exacting standards. Our proprietary aging process yields a minimum aging cycle of 42 days on all beef cuts, with the exception of our center cut New York strip, which is aged 50 days. A Fitting Finale Fine food deserves an ovation, so we believe dessert is a course all its own. Grill 225's Executive Pastry Chef Gerry Elliot has overseen the Hotel's confections since the beginning, and he has designed Charleston's most extensive menu of divine desserts. His signature creations include Baked Carolina - a popular dessert that is flambéed table-side and served family-style - and Banana Bread Pudding served warm with caramel sauce and caramel ice cream. The dessert course is thoughtfully prepared and artistically presented, a fitting finale to a masterful meal.
