Pleasant Reviews LEAVE A REVIEW Sort By Star Rating Date Jonetta Gaddis Monday, February 10, 2025 5 out of 5 Awesome, artistic atmosphere! Jamming music too! One of the managers, Ashley, is exceptional. She came over and greeted me and made sure I was a satisfied customer. Which, I was. I had the chicken tacos and queso and rice. Make sure you also ask for Cara. A great waitress! I would definitely recommend Condado's Tacos! Travel Teacher Anjah Tuesday, December 17, 2024 5 out of 5 Anjah at Condado Tacos was amazing! She made our meal fun with her friendly and quirky attitude. She was quick, knew the menu well, and took great care of us. We’ll be back for sure. Thanks, Anjah! Fresa H Saturday, August 24, 2024 5 out of 5 Texas took great care of us. She walked us through the menu and her recommendations were on point. Her Margaritas were delicious!
