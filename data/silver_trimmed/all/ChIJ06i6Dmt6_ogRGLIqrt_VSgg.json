Everything I ordered was truly exquisite. If in Charleston, book a table do not think about it. Service was very attentive and made some great suggestions for ordering. Live music was great and not so loud as to take away from an intimate dinner. Fantastic place.\n\nReview by - Tripadvisor\n\nAshley F:\n\nWe had the most amazing meal at Hall's. The service is truly 5-star and the steak was probably the best steak I have ever eaten. We were here to celebrate a special event, and we were treated as such. Our servers took time to give us personalized recommendations and the sommelier helped us select a delicious wine. We would highly recommend and can't wait to dine again. We will be back soon!\n\nReview by - Tripadvisor\n\nDaniel B:\n\nExcellent food, attentive staff, outside seating. We were visiting Charleston on our journey across the country. We wanted a special dinner to celebrate. We choose an early seating on their outside patio, it was perfect. Safe and separate.\n\nReview by - Tripadvisor\n\nJohn S:\n\nOutstanding Dinner and exceptional service highly recommend the dry aged strip steak and the she crab soup. A dining experience you won’t forget definitely will go back on our next trip to Charleston. Oh and the whiskey bread pudding mouth watering!!!\n\nReview by - Tripadvisor\n\nBob T:\n\nHalls is always superb and well deserves its recurrent place on the 10 best restaurants list. The service is always fantastic with the best and friendliest staff around town. The variety of steaks available - wet aged, dry aged, etc. - makes it impossible to not find one's favorite here. If your local this should be on your repeat list, if your visiting it should be a not to be missed.\nStop reviews carousel Play reviews carousel \nLocation\n\n434 King Street\n\nCharleston, SC\n\n29403\n\nHours\n\nDINNER\n\nMonday - Thursday 4:00pm - 11:00pm\n\nFriday 4:00pm - 12:00am\n\nSaturday 4:30pm - 12:00am\n\nSunday 4:30pm - 11:00pm\n\nSATURDAY LUNCH\n\nSaturday 11:00am - 2:30pm\n\nSUNDAY BRUNCH\n\nSunday 10:00am - 2:00pm\n\n+ SPECIAL HOURS +\n\nThanksgiving Day 12:00pm - 8:00pm\n\nFriday, Nov. 28 Lunch 11:00am - 2:00pm, Dinner beginning at 4:00pm\n\nFriday, Dec. 5 Lunch 11:00am - 2:00pm, Dinner beginning at 4:00pm\n\nFriday, Dec. 12 Lunch 11:00am - 2:00pm, Dinner beginning at 4:00pm\n\nFriday, Dec. 19 Lunch 11:00am - 2:00pm, Dinner beginning at 4:00pm\n\nChristmas Eve 3:00pm - 9:00pm\n\nChristmas Day closed\n\nNew Year's Eve 4:00pm - midnight\n\nFind us on...\nFacebook page Instagram page Google page \nContact us\n(843)-727-0090 ContactUs02@hallmanagementgroup.com Careers Donation Requests Locations Private Dining Shop \nPowered by:\nWebsite design, Social Media marketing and Email marketing provided by SpotHopper.",
