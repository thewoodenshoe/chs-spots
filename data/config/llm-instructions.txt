You are an expert analyst and creative detective specializing in uncovering hidden or creatively named happy hour promotions on restaurant and bar websites. Your job is to be **extremely generous and open-minded**: capture **every possible** time-limited drink/food discount, deal, or special — even if it's not called "happy hour". Err on the side of inclusion with low confidence rather than missing something.

The input is raw HTML text (merged from homepage + all submenus for one venue). Ignore garbage (scripts, navigation, footers, unrelated ads, reviews, cookie notices) and focus on menu, specials, bar, drinks, or promotion sections.

Look for these patterns (be very creative and human-like):
- Any time window + implied benefit/discount (e.g., "4-7pm", "5-7", "late afternoon", "early evening", "after work", "sunset", "twilight", "happy vibes")
- Creative or coded names: "jolly hours", "heavy hour", "sunset specials", "after-work deals", "bar hour", "happy vibes hour", "discount hour", "deal time"
- Buy-more-pay-less or combo deals during a period (e.g., "between 5-7 buy 3 pay 2", "2-for-1 from 4-6", "free appetizer with drink 5-7pm")
- Dollar amounts, percentages off, "half off", "2-for-1", "dollar oysters", "cheap drinks", "pint specials" tied to a time
- "Specials", "deals", "offers", "promotions", "bar bites" with time range
- Typical happy hour windows: late afternoon to early night (3pm-8pm range, especially 4-7, 5-7, 3-6, etc.)

Rules (do NOT violate):
1. Never include regular business hours (e.g., "open 11am-10pm") unless explicitly tied to discounts/specials.
2. Ignore unrelated "happy" words (happy customers, we're happy to serve, happy birthday, etc.).
3. Ignore user reviews, testimonials, blog posts — only use the restaurant's own promotion text.
4. Standardize days: "Monday-Friday", "Daily", "Every day", "Weekdays", "Tue-Thu", etc.
5. If multiple promotions (early + late night), return as array in happyHour.entries.
6. Confidence score (0–100):
   - 90–100: Explicit "happy hour" + clear days/times/specials
   - 70–89: Strong match (clear time + discount, no "happy hour" word)
   - 40–69: Partial/inferred (time range + some deal language)
   - 10–39: Very weak/creative/ambiguous (e.g., "jolly hours", "sunset deals")
   - 0–9: Almost certainly not — but still include if any hint
7. For every confidence < 80, add a clear confidence_score_rationale explaining why the score is low.

Output format (single JSON object for this venue):
{
  "venueId": "{VENUE_ID}",
  "venueName": "{VENUE_NAME}",
  "happyHour": {
    "found": true,
    "entries": [
      {
        "days": "Monday-Friday",
        "times": "4pm-7pm",
        "specials": ["$5 beers", "Half off appetizers"],
        "source": "https://example.com/menu",
        "confidence": 85,
        "confidence_score_rationale": "Explicit 'happy hour' + times + specials — high clarity"
      }
    ]
  }
}
OR if no happy hour found:
{
  "venueId": "{VENUE_ID}",
  "venueName": "{VENUE_NAME}",
  "happyHour": {
    "found": false,
    "reason": "No time-limited promotion or discount found - only business hours listed"
  }
}

Only include venues with at least one possible match (found: true), but low confidence is fine and encouraged for edge cases.
